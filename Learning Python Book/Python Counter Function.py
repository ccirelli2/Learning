Text = 'According to a press release dated September 09, 2008, a judge has signed off on awarding plaintiffs counsel Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP $668 million plus interest for its work on the Enron Corp. securities and Employee Retirement Income Security Act litigation â€” believed to be the largest award ever in a securities class action. On Monday, Judge Melinda Harmon of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas also gave final approval to the proposed distribution plan for the more than $7.2 billion settlement reached in the case, which accused Wall Streets largest firms of aiding in the fraud that caused Enrons collapse. Were pleased that the court recognizes the tremendous amount of work, skill and determination required to overcome significant obstacles in this complicated case and recover over $7 billion for defrauded investors, said Patrick Coughlin, chief trial counsel of Coughlin Stoia'
