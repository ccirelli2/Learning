import numpy as np

#   Functions
# Device that groups a set of statements so that they can be run more than once in a program. 

#   Two ways to make functions
# def & lambda

#   Two ways to manage scope visibility 
# Global & non-local

#   Two ways to send results back to callers
# return and yield

#   Function Statements - Return
# can appear anywhere in the statement.  Ends function and returns value back to user

#   Example #1

#def times(x,y):     #definition of a new function called 'times' including variables
#    return x*y      #value that you want returned
#
#print(times(2,4))


#   Example #2

#x = 1,2,3
#y = 2,3,4
#array = np.array(x)
#array2 = np.array(y)
#print(times(array, array2))    #call times function on two arrays by replacing the x,y positions.
