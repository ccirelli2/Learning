<h1>Cadillac Jack Pays $87,200 to Settle EEOC Lawsuit</h1>

<p>ATLANTA  – Cadillac Jack, Inc., a supplier of innovative games and systems based in  Duluth, Ga.,  will pay $87,200 to settle a lawsuit for retaliation filed by the U.S. Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit filed on Sept. 2,  2011 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Civil Action  No. 1:11-cv-02953), the EEOC charged that Cadillac Jack fired Tracey Tucker, an  African-American, from her position as contracts manager in retaliation for her  complaining about race and gender discrimination. Tucker, who had worked for the employer since October  2006, was terminated one day after lodging the discrimination complaint.</p>
<p>Title  VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from subjecting employees to discrimination due  to race, color, religion, sex or national origin. It also prohibits an employer from retaliating  against an employee for complaining about discriminatory conduct.</p>
<p>The  consent decree settling the suit, in addition to the monetary relief, includes  provisions for equal employment opportunity training, reporting, and posting of  anti-discrimination notices. In the suit  and consent decree, Cadillac Jack denied any liability or wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“The EEOC filed this lawsuit in  large part due to the timing of the complaint and termination,” said Robert  Dawkins, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Atlanta District Office. “Fortunately, the parties were able to arrive  at a solution designed to prevent similar occurrences in the future.”</p>
<p>Bernice Williams Kimbrough, EEOC district  director in Atlanta,  noted, “This agency is pleased that the employer in this case made an effort to  resolve the matter quickly. Such  resolutions usually signify an earnest effort to comply with Title VII’s  requirements going forward.”</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for  enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
