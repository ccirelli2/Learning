<h1>Self-Storage Company Sued by EEOC for Sexual Harassment</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Simply Self Storage Subjected Female Property Managers and Associate Managers to Egregious Harassment, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>INDIANAPOLIS – A central Indiana self-storage company violated federal law when it subjected its female property managers and associate managers to a sexually hostile work environment, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit (<em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. OBCompanies, Inc., et al.</em>, Civil Action No. 1:09-cv-1223- WTL-DML), filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Simply Self Storage subjected two female employees and other similarly situated female employees to unwelcome sexual groping, sexual assault, and sexual comments by a male property manager who trained managers and associate managers.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement. The EEOC seeks compensatory damages and punitive damages for the female employees, as well as an injunction enjoining Simply Self Storage from engaging in sex discrimination and requiring it to take other measures to ensure a workplace free of discrimination for current and future employees.</p>
<p>“By showing indifference to complaints, this employer allowed a situation where a harasser was able to go from victim to victim with impunity,” said Laurie A. Young, regional attorney for EEOC’s Indianapolis District Office.  “Having an anti-harassment policy is not enough; an employer must enforce it as well.”</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at: <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
