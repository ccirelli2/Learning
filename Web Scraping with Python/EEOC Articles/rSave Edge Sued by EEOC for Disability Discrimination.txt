<h1>Save Edge Sued by EEOC for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>File Sharpening Company Denied Applicant a Job Because It Regarded Him as Disabled, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commis­sion (EEOC) announced today it has filed a disability discrimination lawsuit against Save Edge, Inc., formerly known as File Sharpening Company, Inc., a Xenia, Ohio-based
industrial file sharpening company.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, Save Edge offered applicant Anthony Hoover an operator position but rescinded it once it learned that he took a prescription drug for a seizure disorder. The EEOC said Save Edge regarded Hoover as a disabled
individual incapable of doing the job.</p>
<p>Discrimination against a person who is disabled or regarded as disabled violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 3:14-cv-211 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Dayton
Division) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.   In its suit, the EEOC seeks back pay for Hoover as well as compensatory and punitive damages, and injunctive relief.</p>
<p>"Under the ADA, it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against someone because he is perceived to have a disability," said EEOC Indianapolis District Office Regional Attorney Laurie Young. "The EEOC will continue to vigorously enforce all
aspects of the ADA's employment provisions."</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
