<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today announced the online posting of its 2014 Federal Training Course schedule, available at <a href="http://www.eeotraining.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeotraining.eeoc.gov|">www.eeotraining.eeoc.gov</a> at <a href="https://secure.kinsail.com/results.asp?p=eeoc&amp;pt=store&amp;GroupID=29207" id="https://secure.kinsail.com/results.asp?p=eeoc&amp;pt=store&amp;GroupID=29207|" style="">https://secure.kinsail.com/results.asp?p=eeoc&amp;pt=store&amp;GroupID=29207</a></p>
<p>The EEOC offers a variety of training programs geared specifically to federal employees.  The interactive training is ideal for federal supervisors and workers, EEO counselors and investigators, agency representatives and attorneys, as well
as anyone else interested in EEO issues and practices affecting the federal workplace. </p>
<p>Course offerings meet training requirements for EEO counselors and investigators as outlined in Management Directive (MD) 110.  Other courses are tailored to meet the needs of federal managers, those responsible for conducting MD-715 barrier
analyses, and drafters of final agency decisions. </p>
<p>"Proactive prevention is the best medicine to stop discrimination before it starts," said Carlton Hadden, director of the EEOC's Office of Federal Operations.  "Education and training on EEO is an effective and modest investment in
preventing workplace disputes."</p>
