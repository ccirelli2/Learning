<h1>EEOC Sues Muskegon Family Care for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Medical Provider Fired Employee with a Disability, Federal Agency Charges</strong></em></p>
<p>DETROIT - Muskegon Family Care, a medical services provider located in Muskegon, Heights, MI, violated federal law by firing an employee due to a disability, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleged in a lawsuit filed
today.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's suit, Avis Lane worked for Muskegon Family Care as an outreach enrollment coordinator for over a month when it fired her based on information obtained during her pre-employment physical.</p>
<p>Firing an employee due to a disability violates the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). EEOC filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan (<em>EEOC v. M.G.H. Family Health Center d/b/a Muskegon Family
Care</em>, Civil Case No.: 1:15-CV-00952) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. EEOC's lawsuit seeks back pay, compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief -- including a court
order prohibiting Muskegon Family Care from firing disabled employees in the future.</p>
<p>"Firing a qualified employee, who successfully performed the job for over a month, based on information obtained during a physical violates the ADA," said Laurie Young, regional attorney for EEOC's Indianapolis District. "Employers cannot use
recommendations from a third-party health examiner without determining for itself whether the employee can actually do the job."</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
