<h1>Fifth Avenue Restaurant Group Settles EEOC Sexual Harassment &amp; Retaliation Charge For $50,000</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Agreement Resolves Claims That a Female Worker Was Sexually Harassed and Then Fired for Reporting the Harassment, Federal Agency Says</em></strong></p>
<p>LAS VEGAS - Fifth Avenue Restaurant Group, one of Las Vegas' largest hospitality groups, has agreed to pay $50,000 to settle a sexual harassment and retaliation charge filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the
federal agency announced today.</p>
<p>A former employee filed a discrimination complaint with EEOC in 2011, alleging that she was suspended and discharged after she complained of being sexually harassed by her supervisor. After investigating the allegations, EEOC determined that the
hospitality group violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, as amended, by retaliating against the female employee after she complained of sexual harassment. Although Fifth Avenue Restaurant Group denies the allegations, the hospitality group
agreed to resolve the matter in a timely manner.</p>
<p>To demonstrate their support of Title VII and without admitting liability, Fifth Avenue Restaurant Group entered into a one-year conciliation agreement with EEOC and the aggrieved former employee, thereby avoiding litigation. Aside from the
monetary relief, Fifth Avenue Restaurant Group will provide anti-harassment training to all employees with additional training for managers and supervisors on the laws enforced by EEOC. EEOC will monitor compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p>"Fifth Avenue Restaurant Group maintains its commitment to its team members and does not tolerate any harassment or retaliation in its workplace," said Frank Bonanno, president of Fifth Avenue Restaurant Group. "We are always looking for ways to
strengthen our relationships with our team members and are happy to work alongside EEOC to ensure our team members' rights are protected."</p>
<p>"We commend the Fifth Avenue Restaurant Group for agreeing to implement measures to prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation in the workplace," said Richard Burgamy, director of EEOC's Las Vegas Local Office. "Employees have the legal
right to object to unlawful discrimination without fear from repercussions such as suspension or discharge."</p>
<p>Eliminating policies and practices that discourage or prohibit individuals from exercising their rights under employment discrimination statutes, or that impede EEOC's investigative or enforcement efforts, is one of six national priorities
identified by the Commission's Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP).</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
