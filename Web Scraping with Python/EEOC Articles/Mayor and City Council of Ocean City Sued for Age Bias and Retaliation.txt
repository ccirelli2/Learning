<h1>Mayor and City Council of Ocean City Sued for Age Bias and Retaliation</h1>

<p>BALTIMORE – The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today announced a lawsuit against the mayor and city council of Ocean City, Md., for violating the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) with regard to its hiring practices.</p>
<p>In its suit, the EEOC charges that the Atlantic Ocean resort town discriminated against Anthony Indge, age 62, when it failed to hire him into the position of full-time airport associate in May 2008. Indge had been employed as a temporary line technician and had filled in as an airport associate in 2007 and 2008. During his interview for the position of full-time airport associate, the airport manager, who was the hiring official, made several ageist comments to Indge, despite having previously informed him that his knowledge and performance made him a valued employee. In May 2008, a less qualified younger applicant, age 45, who had no prior experience as an airport associate was hired. </p>
<p>When Indge learned he was not selected for the full-time position, he complained of age discrimination to several Ocean City management officials and filed a charge with the EEOC. The EEOC further charged that Ocean City retaliated against Indge for complaining about age discrimination when it failed to hire him for vacancies as a temporary line technician for the 2009 season.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement. The suit, (Civil Action No.1:10-cv-02690-JFM), filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division, seeks monetary and injunctive relief, including back wages, liquidated damages, changes in employment policies to eliminate future age-based discrimination and instatement of Indge.</p>
<p>“Ageism is a way of stereotyping or marginalizing people,” said EEOC Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence. “Employers have a responsibility to provide everyone the freedom to compete in the workplace on a fair and level playing field, regardless of age, and to not retaliate against individuals who oppose unlawful practices.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the Commission is available on its web site (<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>).</p></div>
