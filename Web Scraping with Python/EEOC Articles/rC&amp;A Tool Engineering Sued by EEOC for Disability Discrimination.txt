<h1>C&amp;A Tool Engineering Sued by EEOC for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><div style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Tool Company Violated Federal Law by Refusing to Hire Applicant With Vision Impairment, Federal Agency Charges</strong></em></div>
<p>INDIANAPOLIS - C&amp;A Tool Engineering Inc., a manufacturing-tooling company in Churubusco, Ind., violated federal law by failing to hire an applicant on the basis of a vision impairment, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
charged in a lawsuit filed on March 31, 2016.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's suit, the applicant, an experienced and qualified machinist, applied and interviewed for a machinist position. Upon completion of the interview, the applicant was given a job offer conditioned on passing a physical
examination. C&amp;A Tool withdrew the job offer because the exam report referenced a vision impairment.</p>
<p>Failing to hire an individual due to a disability violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). EEOC filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, Fort Wayne Division (<em>EEOC v. C &amp; A Tool Engineering,
Inc.</em>, Civil Action No. 1:16-cv-00111), after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. EEOC's lawsuit seeks back pay, compensatory damages, punitive damages and injunctive relief, including a court
order prohibiting C&amp;A Tool from failing to hire qualified individuals on the basis of disability in the future.</p>
<p>"The ADA protects both job applicants and employees from disability discrimination," said Kenneth L. Bird, acting regional attorney of the Indianapolis District Office. "Employers cannot and should not consider impairments that do not affect job
performance in their hiring decisions. EEOC will vigorously pursue cases where employers ignore this obligation."</p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. The agency's Indianapolis District Office oversees Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and a portion of Ohio. Further information about EEOC is available on its
website at www.eeoc.gov.</p></div>
