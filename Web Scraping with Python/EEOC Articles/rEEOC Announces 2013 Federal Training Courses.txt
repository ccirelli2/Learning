</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Programs  Include OPM Joint Training, 'EEO and HR for Managers &amp; Supervisors'</em></strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today announced the online posting of  its 2013 Federal Training Course schedule, available at <a href="http://www.eeotraining.eeoc.gov">www.eeotraining.eeoc.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The EEOC offers a variety of  training programs geared specifically for federal employees. The interactive training  is ideal for federal supervisors and workers, EEO counselors and investigators,  agency representatives and
attorneys, as well as anyone else interested in EEO  issues and practices affecting the federal workplace.</p>
<p>Course offerings meet training requirements  for EEO counselors and investigators outlined in Management Directive  (MD)-110.  Other courses are tailored to  meet the needs of federal managers, those responsible for conducting
MD-715  barrier analyses, drafters of final agency decisions and those who draft letters  of acceptance and dismissal.</p>
<p>"The EEOC believes that proactive prevention is the best  medicine to stop discrimination before it starts," said Carlton Hadden,  director of the EEOC's Office of Federal Operations. "Education and training on  EEO laws, rules and
regulations are vital to the creation of a model federal  workplace and are effective, efficient and modest investments in preventing  workplace disputes."</p>
<p>The 2013 course schedule includes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><em>EEO and HR for Managers &amp; Supervisors (</em>Joint EEOC/OPM program)</li>
<li><em>Barrier Analysis</em></li>

<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws  prohibiting employment discrimination in the public and private sectors.  Further information is available on EEOC's website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
