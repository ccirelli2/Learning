<h1>EEOC to Hold Public Meeting on Proposed Reboot of Harassment Prevention Efforts</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will hold a meeting on Monday, June 20, 2016, at 9:30 a.m. (Eastern Time), at EEOC headquarters, 131 M Street, N.E., Washington, D.C., to receive the report of Commissioners
Chai Feldblum and Victoria Lipnic, Co-Chairs of the EEOC Select Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace.</p>
<p>In January 2015, EEOC Chair Jenny R. Yang announced the formation of the Select Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace, to be co-chaired by EEOC Commissioners Feldblum and Lipnic. The Select Task Force, consisting of management
and plaintiffs' attorneys, representatives of advocacy groups for employees and for employers, and academics who have studied harassment, held hearings looking into all aspects of workplace harassment and methods for preventing and addressing it.
The Select Task Force was not charged with preparing a consensus report, but rather with providing knowledge and diverse viewpoints to inform the final report prepared by the Co-Chairs. At this meeting, Commissioners Feldblum and Lipnic will present
the findings of their report to their colleagues and the public, including their proposed reboot of workplace harassment prevention efforts.</p>
<p>At the June 20 meeting, the following are confirmed to testify:</p>
