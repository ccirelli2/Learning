</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON - Robert D. Rose, a veteran attorney with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), has been appointed regional attorney of the agency's New York District, which includes offices in New York, Boston, Buffalo and Newark,
the agency announced today.</p>
<p>"The New York District Office has been a key contributor to the success of EEOC's litigation program, particularly in combating systemic discrimination," said EEOC General Counsel David Lopez. "I look forward to the New York office's continued
success under Robert's leadership."</p>
<p>Rose said, "I am deeply honored by General Counsel Lopez's confidence in selecting me for this key role. I look forward to putting the full weight of the New York office behind our mission of eradicating employment discrimination."</p>
<p>Rose began his career at the EEOC in 2001 as a trial attorney and became a supervisory trial attorney in 2007. During his time with the EEOC, he has litigated numerous cases under the statutes enforced by the agency, recovering millions of
dollars for victims of discrimination. This has included trying cases to verdict in jury trials involving race discrimination and sexual harassment. In recent years, Rose has played a significant role in some of the largest cases brought by the
EEOC. He has lectured widely on the laws enforced by the EEOC and trained lawyers on trial practice, negotiations, and other areas. Rose became acting regional attorney for the New York District Office in January 2014.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
