<h1>SITA Information Networking Computing USA Sued By EEOC For Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Air Transport Communications Company Discharged Employee With Cancer While on Short-Term Disability Leave, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>ATLANTA – An Atlanta-based air transport communications  company unlawfully discriminated against an employee because of her cancer  surgery, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a  lawsuit it filed recently.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, SITA Information  Networking Computing USA, Inc. violated federal law by rescinding Darlene  Case’s offer of employment rather than accommodating her. Case was hired as a full-time personal assistant  to SITA’s vice president. Shortly after  accepting the offer of employment, Case learned that she would require surgery  as a result of her cancer. Due to the  surgery, she requested a reasonable accommodation of having her start date  moved and then being allowed to work part-time for the first two weeks. In response, the employer rescinded the employment  offer.</p>
<p>Disability discrimination violates the Americans With  Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires employers to make reasonable accommodations  for employees with disabilities. The  EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement  through its conciliation process. The  EEOC is seeking reinstatement, back pay and compensatory and punitive damages  for Case. The lawsuit also seeks  injunctive relief designed to prevent future discrimination.</p>
<p>“This suit is being filed to ensure that employers  understand that they have an obligation, short of incurring undue hardship, to provide  a reasonable accommodation to employees,” said Robert Dawkins, regional attorney  for EEOC’s Atlanta District Office, which filed the suit.</p>
<p>Bernice Williams-Kimbrough, district director of the Atlanta office, said, “The EEOC is committed to stopping workplace  disability discrimination in Georgia  and across the country.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment  discrimination. Further information  about the EEOC is available on the agency’s web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
