<h1>EEO-1 Survey for 2016 Now Open</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Private Sector Employers Must Provide Workforce Data to EEOC by Sept. 30</em></strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has completed its mailing of the 2016 EEO-1 Survey notification letters.  The EEO-1 is an annual survey that requires all private employers with 100 or more employees and
federal government contractors or first-tier subcontractors with 50 or more employees and a contract/subcontract of $50,000 or more to file the EEO-1 report.  The filing of the EEO-1 report is not voluntary and is required by federal law,
Section 709(c), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; and §1602.7-§1602.14, Title 29, Chapter XIV, of the Federal Code of Regulations.  The annual filing deadline is Sept. 30 </p>
<p>The EEO-1 report provides valuable employment data by race/ethnicity, gender and job categories, and is used by researchers, private attorneys, human resource staff, etc. in developing affirmative action plans, and in the Commission's enforcement
of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p>Employers who meet the criteria listed above, or employers that filed the EEO-1 report in 2015 and have not received the 2016 EEO-1 notification letter by Aug.15, 2016, should immediately contact the EEO-1 Joint Reporting Committee at
1-877-392-4647 (toll-free) or e-mail <a href="mailto:e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov">e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov</a>.    </p>
<p>Deidre M. Flippen, director of the office of research, information and planning, announced new enhancements for uploading EEO-1 data files.  "Companies will now be able to test and upload their data files without needing to email data files
or wait for confirmation.  This new method of submitting data files will save time and provide companies with immediate notification of any errors requiring corrections. This should go a long way toward helping employers to meet the Sept. 30
deadline," Flippen said</p>
