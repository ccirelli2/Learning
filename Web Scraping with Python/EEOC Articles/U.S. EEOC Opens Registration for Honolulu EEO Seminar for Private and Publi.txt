<p>HONOLULU - The federal agency tasked with enforcing laws against employment discrimination, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), announced that registration has opened for its EEOC Honolulu Technical Assistance Program Seminar
(TAPS) for both private and public employer representatives, confirmed to take place on Sept. 15 in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>
<p>Glory Gervacio Saure, the EEOC's Honolulu local director, is hosting this seminar in Hawaii for the first time in 15 years. This year's seminar will feature keynote presentations by the EEOC's Los Angeles district director, Rosa Viramontes; EEOC
Supervisory Administrative Judge Diane Gross; EEOC Supervisory Trial Attorney Rumduol Vuong and EEOC Honolulu Local Office Director Glory Gervacio Saure. Officials from the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
and the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs are also slated to present.</p>
<p>The seminar is geared toward attorneys, mediators, human resource, union officials and equal employment opportunity (EEO) professionals in the private and federal sectors, along with other interested parties. The comprehensive training sessions
and workshops will provide updates and guidance on EEO law and how to approach EEO cases the way the EEOC experts do. There is also a federal sector track for EEO professionals and attorneys representing federal agencies, along with a selection of
workshops to customize the learning experience.</p>
<p>"The last time the EEOC presented this type of training seminar in Hawaii was in 2002," said Glory Gervacio Saure, local director for the EEOC Honolulu Local Office. "We are very pleased to be hosting this one-of-a-kind seminar where the EEOC
brings together experts to share their knowledge with the employer community in Hawaii."</p>
<p>Rosa Viramontes, district director for the EEOC's Los Angeles District, which includes Hawaii in its jurisdiction, added, "We are thrilled to return to Hawaii to connect with local employer representatives. Our seminar is an opportunity to hear
firsthand from EEOC officials who will provide updates and guidance on how to address and prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation in the workplace."</p>
