<h1>Graceworks Lutheran Services to Pay $30,660 to Settle EEOC Disability Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>

<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;">Company Refused to Hire Applicant Because of Her Deafness, Federal Agency Charged</p>
<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Graceworks Lutheran Services, a housing and care service provider located in Dayton, Ohio - with over 1,000 employees in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky - will pay $30,660 to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit filed by the
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, Graceworks Lutheran Services refused to hire Michelle Anthony because she is deaf and cannot speak. Anthony applied for the site manager position at one of the Graceworks' housing communities. Despite its being an
apartment complex that gives preference to deaf residents, Graceworks required the successful job candidate to be a hearing individual.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 3:15-cv-00261) in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Dayton Division, after first attempting to reach
pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>The consent decree settling the suit provides Anthony with compensatory damages and injunctive relief, including anti-discrimination training, reporting of discrimination claims, and a prohibition against any discrimination or retaliation.</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the latest EEOC news by
