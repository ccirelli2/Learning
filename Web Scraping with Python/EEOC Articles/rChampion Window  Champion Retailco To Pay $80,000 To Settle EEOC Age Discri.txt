<h1>Champion Window / Champion Retailco To Pay $80,000 To Settle EEOC Age Discrimination Suit</h1>

<p>ATLANTA – Champion Window Company of Columbus, Ga.,  LLC, a retailer and installer of window, door, vinyl siding and patio rooms, and  its corporate parent, Champion Retailco, LLC, will pay $80,000 to settle an age  discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, filed on July 26, 2010 in U.S.  District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, Columbus Division (Case No.:  4:10-CV-00080-CDL), the EEOC charged that a top manager reportedly issued an  order that installation manager Ronald Henderson be fired and “someone young  and energetic” be hired in his place. Further,  the agency charged that the employer had Henderson  train his much younger replacement just prior to his own discharge.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Age Discrimination  in Employment Act (ADEA), which prohibits employers from subjecting employees to discrimination  due to age. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to  reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>The consent decree settling the suit, in addition to the  monetary relief, includes provisions for equal employment opportunity training and  reporting and posting of anti-discrimination notices. In the suit and consent decree, Champion denied  any liability or wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“The  Commission is pleased that Champion committed to resolving this matter and to  taking the necessary steps to ensure future compliance with the law,” said  Robert Dawkins, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Atlanta District Office.</p>
<p>The  EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further  information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov.</a></p></div>
