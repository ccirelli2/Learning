<h1>EEOC Sues Guardian Angel Ambulance Service for Breach of a Settlement Agreement</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Ambulance Company Failed to Make Promised Payments to Resolve Race and Sex Discrimination Charge, Federal Agency Says</em></strong></p>
<p>PITTSBURGH -- Guardian Angel Ambulance Service, Inc. violated federal law by failing to comply with a negotiated agreement settlement of a discrimination charge, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it
announced today.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Mekia Austin filed a charge of discrimination alleging that she had been sexually harassed and terminated because of her race (black) and sex. Austin died during the EEOC's investigation. The ambulance service entered
into a pre-determination settlement agreement to resolve the charge. It agreed to pay a total of $5,000 to Austin's two surviving minor children, but the company paid only $800 to the children, the EEOC charged.</p>
<p>To enforce the terms of the settlement agreement, the EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (<em>EEOC v. Guardian Angel Ambulance Service, Inc.,</em> Civil Action No. 2:13-cv-01205). The EEOC is
requesting a court order requiring the ambulance service to pay $4,200, plus interest, to the minor children, report the payments to the EEOC after they are made, and pay the EEOC's costs in filing this action.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence said, "When an employer refuses to honor the promises it made in a voluntary settlement agreement, the EEOC will file suit to enforce that agreement."</p>
<p>District Director Spencer H. Lewis, Jr., of the EEOC's Philadelphia District Office added, "We encourage employers and charging parties to reach a resolution that both parties find satisfactory. A voluntary settlement is not an admission of
liability, and it often saves all parties the time and expense of a full investigation or even possible litigation. But the EEOC will take action if an employer fails to comply with a negotiated settlement agreement."</p>
<p>The Philadelphia District Office of the EEOC oversees Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia and parts of New Jersey and Ohio.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the Commission is available at its website, <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
