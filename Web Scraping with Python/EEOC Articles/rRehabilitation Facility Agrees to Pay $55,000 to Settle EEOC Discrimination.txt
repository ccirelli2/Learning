<h1>Rehabilitation Facility Agrees to Pay $55,000 to Settle EEOC Discrimination Suit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>CHICAGO - Alden Estates of Naperville, Inc. will pay $55,000 to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today. EEOC's suit had alleged that Alden fired
its admissions director while she was out on a medical leave of absence, one week before she was able to return to work. Alden Estates of Naperville, Inc. provides transitional care and rehabilitation services to patients in the western suburbs of
Chicago.</p>
<p>Disability discrimination violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). EEOC filed suit on July 22, 2014 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation
settlement through its conciliation process. (<em>EEOC v. Alden Estates of Naperville</em>, N.D. Ill. No. 14 cv 5588).</p>
<p>EEOC Regional Attorney John Hendrickson said he was pleased with the relatively quick resolution of this case. "When a case settles quickly without drawn-out litigation, everyone wins," said Hendrickson. "EEOC obtains the relief it seeks, and
Alden can continue to focus on the business of providing health care."</p>
<p>The case was litigated by Trial Attorney Jeanne Szromba and Supervisory Trial Attorney Diane Smason in EEOC's Chicago District Office, which is responsible for process-ing charges of discrimination, administrative enforcement and the conduct of
agency litigation in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, with Area Offices in Milwaukee and Minneapolis.</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment. Further information about the Commission is available on its website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
