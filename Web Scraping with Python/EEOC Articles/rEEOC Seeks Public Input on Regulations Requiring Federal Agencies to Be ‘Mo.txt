<h1>EEOC Seeks Public Input on Regulations Requiring Federal Agencies to Be ‘Model Employers’ of Individuals with Disabilities</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today that it is inviting public input on potential revisions to the regulations implementing Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a law that governs
employment of individuals with disabilities by the federal government.</p>
<p>Current Section 501 regulations prohibit employment discrimination based on disability and explain the standards for determining whether discrimination has occurred. The regulations also impose a separate obligation on federal agencies to be
"model employers" of individuals with disabilities, but do not explain what federal agencies must do to comply with this obligation.</p>
<p>The Commission is proposing to revise its regulations to include a more detailed explanation of the model employer obligation. Before it publishes a proposed regulation, however, the Commission is issuing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(ANPRM) that seeks comments from members of the public on what the amended regulations should say.</p>
<p>The EEOC welcomes input from federal agencies, individuals, employers, advocacy groups, agency stakeholders, and other interested parties. The Commission is specifically seeking answers to seven questions listed in the announcement, such as what
barriers exist to the hiring, retention, and advancement of individuals with disabilities in the federal government, what regulatory requirements could eliminate these barriers, and whether numerical goals should be established for the employment of
people with disabilities by the federal government. The ANPRM is now available on the Federal Register website at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/a/2014-11233">https://www.federalregister.gov/a/2014-11233</a>. Responses to the ANPRM must be
submitted by 5:00 pm EDT on Monday, July 14, 2014.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
