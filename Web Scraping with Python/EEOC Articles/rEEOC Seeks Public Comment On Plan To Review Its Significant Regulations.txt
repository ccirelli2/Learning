<h1>EEOC Seeks Public Comment on Plan To Review its Significant Regulations</h1>
</div>

Reg. 3821 (Jan. 21, 2011).</p>
<p>Executive Order 13563 directs each federal agency to develop "a preliminary plan, consistent with law and its resources and regulatory priorities, under which the agency will periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine whether such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded or repealed to make the agency's regulatory program more effective and/or less burdensome in achieving its regulatory objectives."</p>
<p>The EEOC is soliciting public comment to assist in the development of its plan to periodically review existing significant regulations, including input on factors the Commission should consider, the process it should use, and the specific regulations that should be reviewed in the next two years.</p>
<p>Public comments may be submitted to <a href="mailto:Public.Comments.RegulatoryReview@eeoc.gov" id="mailto:Public.Comments.RegulatoryReview@eeoc.gov|">Public.Comments.RegulatoryReview@eeoc.gov</a> through March 22, 2011.
