</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Pact Establishes Ongoing Collaborative Relationship Between the Two Entities</em></strong></p>
<p>ATLANTA - The Atlanta District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the consular section of the Philippine embassy to the United States on July 19 in Augusta, Ga.
The agreement establishes an ongoing collaboration between these entities to provide Philippine nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources about workers' rights under the laws enforced by EEOC. Philippine Third Secretary and Vice
Consul Darell Artates, on behalf of Minister and Consul General Emilio T. Fernandez, and EEOC Atlanta District Office Outreach Manager Terrie Dandy, on behalf of District Director Bernice Williams-Kimbrough, signed the agreement.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to enter into this important partnership with the embassy's consular section to enhance efforts to reach, educate, and protect Philippine nationals in Georgia and parts of South Carolina covered by the EEOC's Atlanta District
Office," said Williams-Kimbrough. "We are committed to assisting and protecting immigrant, migrant and other vulnerable workers from employment discrimination, and this agreement helps to further those efforts with the Filipino community."</p>
<p>Philippine Ambassador Jose L. Cuisia, Jr. said, "We welcome this new formal partnership with the EEOC's Atlanta District Office. Alliances with local and district offices are essential to the embassy's thrust towards more nimble, constructive and
responsive labor-related engagements across the United States. The cooperation and assistance of the EEOC Atlanta District Office will provide invaluable support to the embassy's efforts to ensure that Filipinos working in Georgia and parts of South
Carolina are given increased protection and appropriate welfare interventions."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the MOU, EEOC will provide outreach and information aimed at making Philippine nationals aware of the laws that prohibit employment discrimination and their rights under the laws. EEOC will also disseminate compliance and
educational materials to the embassy's constituency, as well as provide training on the application and enforcement of laws enforced by EEOC for embassy staff.</p>
<p>The Atlanta District Office includes the EEOC Savannah Local Office and has jurisdiction over Georgia and the following 12 counties in South Carolina: Beaufort, Charleston, Jasper, Hampton, Colleton, Allendale, Dorchester, Berkeley, Williamsburg,
Georgetown, Barnwell and Bambert.</p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
