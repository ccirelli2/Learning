<h1>Reliable Nissan Agrees to Settle EEOC Race, Religion and National Origin Harassment Case</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Minority Employees Were Subjected to Degrading Slurs and Innuendos</em></strong></p>
<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - Reliable Inc., doing business as Reliable Nissan, along with other entities involved in operating the Albuquerque car dealership, has agreed to settle charges of discrimination based on race, national origin, and religion,
along with retaliation, that were filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today. </p>
<p>The agreement follows conciliation between the EEOC and Reliable Nissan over claims that two Reliable Nissan Managers repeatedly used the "N-word" during a sales meeting, and referred to African, African-American, Native American, Muslim and
Hispanic employees in a derogatory manner. Employees alleged that managers made offensive jokes about Muslim and Native American employees' religious practices and traditions, and used racial epithets like "n----r," "drunken Indians," "red." and
"redskins." Racially offensive pictures targeted against minority employees were also posted in the workplace.</p>
<p>The EEOC investigated the charges and found that the racial slurs and innuendos created a hostile work environment for minority employees, and that Reliable Nissan failed to take prompt and remedial action to stop the harassment. The EEOC's
investigation further revealed that employees who complained were retaliated against.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits an employer from discriminating against employees because of their race, national origin or religion. Title VII also protects employees who complain about
discrimination from retaliation.</p>
<p>As part of the conciliation agreement, Reliable Nissan agreed to pay a total of $205,000 to three emp­loyees who filed discrimination charges with the EEOC and 11 other minority employees who were subjected to the hostile work environment. The
company also agreed to provide annual training for two years for its emp­loyees, including managers and human resources employees. Additionally, Reliable Nissan agreed to re­view its policies and procedures to ensure that employees have a mechanism
for reporting discrimination and to make certain that each complaint will be appropriately investigated.</p>
<p>"It is important for all employees to feel safe and free to come forward with reports of harassment," said EEOC Albuquerque Area Director Derick Newton. "As soon as an employer becomes aware of any kind of harassment because of race, national
origin, or religion, the employer must act promptly and appropriately."</p>
<p>EEOC Phoenix Office District Director Elizabeth Cadle added, "It is illegal for employees to be subjected to such degrading comments and innuendos based on their race, national origin and religion. The EEOC will continue to hold employers
accountable for such offensive and discriminatory conduct."</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.  Stay connected with the latest EEOC news by
