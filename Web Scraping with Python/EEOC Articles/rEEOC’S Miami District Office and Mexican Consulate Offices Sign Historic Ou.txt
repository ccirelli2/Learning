</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Pact Establishes  Ongoing Collaborative Relationship Between the Two Entities</em></strong></p>
<p>ORLANDO, Fla. -- The Miami District Office of the U.S.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU) in Orlando today with the Consulate General of Mexico in  Miami and Consulate
of Mexico in Orlando.   The agreement establishes an ongoing collaboration between these  entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to  resources on the prevention of discrimination in the
workplace regardless of  immigration status.  Mexican Consul Efran  Nicolas Leyva Acevedo of Orlando and Miami District Office Director Malcolm S.  Medley signed the agreement.  Acting  Mexican Consul General Vladimir
Hernandez Lara of Miami signed the document  prior to the meeting today.</p>
<p>"By signing this  Memorandum of Understanding today with the Mexican Consulate, we of the EEOC's  Miami District have solidified our continued and longstanding commitment to this  underserved community," said Medley. 
"This  agreement provides the opportunity for on­going education, outreach and service  by the EEOC to Mexican nationals in our area.  We look forward to a long-lasting and  significant partnership."</p>
<p>  Under the terms of the MOU, the EEOC will expand its  relationship with these two consulates by providing them with Spanish-language  materials explaining the laws enforced by the federal agency.  In addition, the EEOC will
partner with consulate  offices to provide information and training to areas of the state where migrant  farm workers and other Mexican nationals live and work.</p>
<p>The EEOC's Miami District Office is comprised of the  Miami, Tampa and San Juan EEOC offices, and has jurisdiction over Florida,  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   The EEOC's Tampa Field Office has already begun
partnership efforts by  providing information and counseling to people on the laws EEOC enforces by visiting  Mexican mobile consulate sites.  The EEOC's  Miami District Office is currently involved in plans for the agency's
participation  in various "Labor Rights Week" events scheduled throughout the state at the end  of August by the Miami Consulate General and Orlando Consulate offices.  "Labor Rights Week" is an initiative to  educate Mexican
nationals and other Latinos about their civil rights, workplace  safety, minimum wage laws, and human trafficking.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing  federal laws against employment discrimination.   Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
