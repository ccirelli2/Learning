<p>ATLANTA – An Atlanta retail chain violated federal law when it fired an employee because of her age, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today. According to the EEOC’s suit, Civ. Ac. # 409-cv-160, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Charming Shoppes, Inc., doing business as Fashion Bug of Rome, also subjected Angela Ray, a co-manager at the Rome, Ga., store, to discriminatory terms and conditions of employment because of her age, including disparate discipline, prior to her termination.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement. The EEOC is seeking back pay, liquidated damages and reinstatement for Ray. The lawsuit also seeks injunctive relief designed to stop the discrimination and prevent it from recurring in the future.</p>
<p>According to company information, Charming Shoppes, Inc. also owns Lane Bryant, Catherine’s, Crosstown Traders, Petite Sophisticate and other retailers. The company operates 26 stores in the Atlanta area and employs approximately 100-200 employees.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing the nation’s laws prohibiting employment discrimination based on race, color, gender, religion, national origin, age, disability, and retaliation.
