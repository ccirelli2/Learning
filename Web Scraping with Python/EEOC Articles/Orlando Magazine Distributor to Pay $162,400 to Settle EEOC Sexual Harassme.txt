<h1>Orlando Magazine Distributor to Pay $162,400 to Settle EEOC Sexual Harassment Lawsuit</h1>

<p>MIAMI – Prologix Distribution Services (East), LLC, an Orlando, Fla.-based magazine distributor, will pay $162,400 and furnish other relief to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>Prologix provides distribution services for publishers relating to merchandising, warehousing, and the delivery of magazines.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s complaint, several women who worked at Prologix’s Orlando, Fla., facility as magazine order fillers were subjected to harassment by a longtime supervisor. The harassment included the making of sexually explicit remarks and inappropriate touching and groping of the women.</p>
<p>In addition to monetary damages in the amount of $162,400, the three-year consent decree resolving the case (<em>EEOC v. Prologix Distribution Services (East), LLC</em>, Case No. 6:09-cv-01681-MSS-GJK), filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, includes injunctive relief enjoining the company from engaging in further sexual harassment; requires the company to post a notice about the settlement; to conduct anti-discrimination training; and to report information about sex discrimination complaints it receives to the EEOC for monitoring.</p>
<p>“No one should be subjected to this type of harassing conduct in the modern workplace,” said EEOC Regional Attorney Robert Weisberg. “Employers must take appropriate steps to assure that this kind of abuse does not occur.”</p>
<p>Trial Attorney Kaleb Kasperson said, “Inappropriate touching and lewd comments are perfect examples of conduct which has no place at work. The law requires that the workplace be free from this type of blatant harassment and sexual innuendo.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
