<h1>EEOC, Huyssen, Inc., Licensed to Use the Registered Service Mark Sedona Staffing, and Sedona Group Reach Agreement on Discrimination Case Involving Recruitment and Hiring</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>SAN DIEGO, Calif.  - Huyssen, Inc., licensed to use the registered service mark Sedona Staffing and the Sedona Group, agreed to pay $920,000 and implement preventive measures to settle a variety of discrimination charges filed with the U.S.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today.  </p>
<p>"We are pleased that Huyssen and Sedona Group worked cooperatively with the EEOC to reach a resolution that will correct and prevent discrimination in recruitment and hiring," said Marla Stern-Knowlton, director of the EEOC's San Diego Local
Office.  </p>
<p>The settlement resolves six EEOC discrimination charges filed between 2007 and 2009 alleging that the staffing firm engaged in a pattern and practice of classifying and failing to refer job applicants in San Diego based on their race, color, sex,
national origin, age or disability.  </p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Without admitting liability, Huyssen and Sedona agreed to enter into a five-year
conciliation agreement with the EEOC and alleged victims, thereby avoiding litigation.  The settlement includes a class fund for currently unidentified victims who also suffered similar discrimination during the relevant time
period.  </p>
<p>Potential claimants will include men and women of various races and national origins, individuals 40 years of age and older, and those with disabilities, who applied for referral employment through Huyssen, Inc. of San Diego during the period of
March 1, 2007 - May 31, 2008.   Within the next four months, the Claims Administrator will be issuing claims packets to potential claimants.  Website links for the Claims Administrator will also be posted on the EEOC and Sedona
Staffing of San Diego websites.  </p>
<p>Aside from the monetary relief, Huyssen agreed to provide annual equal employment opportunity (EEO) and diversity training to all employees at its San Diego location, with an emphasis on non-discriminatory referral and hiring procedures. 
Huyssen also agreed to hire an independent EEO consultant to assist the company in revising its EEO policies and complaint procedures, training and compliance with the agreement.  </p>
<p>Eliminating barriers in recruitment and hiring, especially class-based recruitment and hiring practices that discriminate against racial, ethnic and religious groups, older workers, women, and people with disabilities, is one of six national
priorities identified by the Commission's Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP).  </p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
