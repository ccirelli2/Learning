</div>
<div align="left"><p>CHICAGO - Gregory M. Gochanour, who has worked in EEOC's Chicago District Office since 1993, first as trial attorney, and since 2001 as a supervisory trial attorney, has been appointed the District Office's regional attorney, effective Jan. 8,
the federal agency announced today.</p>
<p>Gochanour, who holds an A.B. degree in economics from the University of Chicago and received his law degree from the University of Michigan, worked for the law firms of Akin Gump in Dallas and Lewis and Roca in Phoenix prior to joining EEOC. At
EEOC he has developed and litigated significant systemic cases involving a range of issues and resulting in a number of large multi-million-dollar settlements. In these cases and others, he has helped shape some of the agency's most complex law
development theories. Gochanour also has taught employment discrimination law at Loyola University of Chicago Law School for the past 10 years.</p>
<p>"EEOC's Chicago District has been responsible for some of the agency's most significant legal work with respect to both relief obtained for discrimination victims and advances in the law," said James Lee, EEOC's deputy general counsel. "Greg has
been instrumental in many of the office's achievements, and the agency is truly fortunate to have him as Chicago's new regional attorney."</p>
<p>Gochanour said, "I am honored to be selected and look forward to working with the outstanding staff in the Chicago District to continue and build on the success that has been attained under the leadership of my predecessor, John Hendrickson."</p>
<p>Julianne Bowman, Chicago's district director, added, "The enforcement and legal staff of the Chicago District have a long and successful history of working together to produce cases that have had a significant impact on
discrimination. I look forward to continuing this tradition with Greg's leadership as the regional attorney."</p>
<p>The Chicago District is responsible for handling charges of employment discrimination, administrative enforcement and the conduct of agency litigation in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and North and South Dakota, with Area Offices in
Milwaukee and Minneapolis.</p>
<p>EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the
