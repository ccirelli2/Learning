<h1>EEO-1 Survey for 2015 Now Open</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Private Sector Employers Must Provide Workforce Data to EEOC by Sept. 30</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has completed its mailing of the 2015 EEO-1 survey notification letters, the federal agency announced today. The EEO-1 is an annual survey required to be filed by all private
employers with 100 or more employees and federal government contractors or first-tier subcontractors with 50 or more employees and a contract/subcontract of $50,000 or more. The filing of the EEO-1 report is not voluntary, and is required by federal
law.  The filing deadline is Sept. 30, 2015.  </p>
<p>The EEO-1 report provides valuable employment data by race/ethnicity, gender and job categories, and is used by researchers, private attorney and human resource staff in developing affirmative action plans and in the Commission's enforcement of
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
<p>Employers who meet the criteria listed above, or who filed the EEO-1 report in 2014 and have not received the 2015 EEO-1 notification letter by the end of August 2015, should immediately contact the EEO-1 Joint Reporting Committee at
1-877-392-4647 (toll-free) or e-mail at <a href="mailto:e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov">e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov</a>. If you have any questions about the EEO-1 survey, please contact the EEO-1 Joint Reporting Committee at 1-877-392-4647 (toll-free) or
by e-mail at <a href="mailto:e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov">e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov</a>.  </p>
<p>"Beginning with this year's EEO-1 survey, companies will have the ability to obtain and reset their passwords themselves," Deidre M. Flippen, director of EEOC's Office of Research, Information and Planning, pointed out. "This new and simple
process enables the EEO-1 Joint Reporting Committee to better protect employer information while meeting the Sept. 30 deadline.<sup>"</sup></p>
