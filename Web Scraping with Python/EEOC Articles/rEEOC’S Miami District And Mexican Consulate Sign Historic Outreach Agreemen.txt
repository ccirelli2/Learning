<h1>EEOC’S Miami District And Mexican Consulate Sign Historic Outreach Agreement</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Pact Establishes Ongoing Collaborative Relationship Between the Two Entities</em></strong></p>
<p>ORLANDO, Fla. -- The Miami District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in Orlando today with the Consulate of Mexico in Orlando. The agreement establishes an ongoing
collaboration between these entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace regardless of immigration status. Mexican Consul Juan Sabines Guerrero of
Orlando and Georgia Marchbanks, who represented the Miami District Office in her capacity as Tampa Field Office Director, signed the agreement.</p>
<p>"The signing of this MOU renews our collaborative relationship with the Mexican Consulate to provide the opportunity for ongoing education, outreach and service by the EEOC to Mexican nationals in our area." said Marchbanks. "The EEOC is
committed to stopping and remedying unlawful employment discrimination against immigrant, migrant, and other vulnerable workers."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the MOU, EEOC will expand its relationship with the consulate by providing them with Spanish-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the federal agency. In addition, EEOC will partner with the consulate office to
provide information and training to areas of the state where migrant farm workers and other Mexican nationals live and work. The EEOC's Miami District Office is comprised of the Miami, Tampa and San Juan EEOC offices, and has jurisdiction over
Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>EEOC offices in both Miami and Tampa are currently involved in plans for the agency's participation in various "Labor Rights Week" events, which begin today and are scheduled throughout the state. "Labor Rights Week" is an initiative to educate
Mexican nationals and other Latinos about their civil rights, workplace safety, minimum wage laws, and human trafficking.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
