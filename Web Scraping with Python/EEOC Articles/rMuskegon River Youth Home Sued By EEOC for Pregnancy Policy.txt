<h1>Muskegon River Youth Home Sued By EEOC for Pregnancy Policy</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Company's Policy Requiring Immediate  Notification of Pregnancy Is Discriminatory, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>DETROIT - The U.S. Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today announced that it filed a  lawsuit against Muskegon River Youth Home in Muskegon, Mich., for maintaining a  discriminatory pregnancy policy for its
employees. </p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, the  home's policies require employees to immediately notify the company once the  employee learns she is pregnant, and requires her to produce a certification  from her doctor that she is capable of
continuing to work."</p>
<p>The EEOC filed suit against  Muskegon River Youth Home in U.S. District Court for the Western District of  Michigan, arguing that the policy is a form of pregnancy discrimination that  violates the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, a
part of Title VII of the Civil  Rights Act (<em>EEOC v. Muskegon River Youth  Home.,</em> Case No. 1:12-cv-01049). The EEOC's suit seeks an injunction against  the company which would prohibit Muskegon River Youth Home from
maintaining its  pregnancy policy.</p>
<p>"Maintaining such a policy  violates the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which safeguards the rights of  pregnant employees to the same treatment as others," said EEOC Trial Attorney  Nedra Campbell.  The EEOC takes
seriously  a pregnant woman's right to the same terms and conditions of employment."  </p>
<p>Muskegon River Youth Home is a  private detention center for troubled teens.   Muskegon River  Youth Home is  based in the city of Muskegon, and has been in business since 1996.</p>
<p>The EEOC is the federal agency  that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is  available on the agency's web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
