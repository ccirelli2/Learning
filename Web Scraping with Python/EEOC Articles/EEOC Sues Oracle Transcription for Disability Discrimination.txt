<h1>EEOC Sues Oracle Transcription for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Agency Charges That Medical Transcription Company Denied Job Based on Stereotypes of People with Multiple Sclerosis</em></strong></p>
<p>BALTIMORE – A Rockville, Md., medical transcription company violated federal law when it refused to hire a medical transcriptionist to a full-time job because of its stereotypes about people with multiple sclerosis, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it announced today.</p>
<p>In its suit, the EEOC said that since at least May 2006 and continuing to the present, Oracle Transcription, Inc. denied Mary Bobik a position as a full-time medical transcription editor. Oracle’s supervisor told Bobik that they didn’t want to “stress her out” with the responsibilities of a full-time position, even though she had worked at Oracle Transcription for several years and was regularly assigned to work more than 60 hours a week as a part-time editor. Bobik had nearly 20 years as a medical transcriptionist and as an editor and was physically capable and willing to perform the duties, the EEOC said. Instead, Oracle Transcription ignored Bobik’s requests for a full-time job and hired other persons with less experience.</p>
<p>The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) makes it unlawful to discriminate against a qualified individual because of a disability. The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 8:09-cv-02564 RWT) in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Southern District, after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement. The complaint seeks monetary and injunctive relief, including back wages, compensatory and punitive damages and changes in employment policies to provide equal employment opportunities for qualified individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>“Many people, including Mary Bobik, have demonstrated their ability to perform their jobs just fine regardless of MS,” said EEOC Acting Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence. “She worked many long hours for Oracle and was able and willing to continue to do so.”</p>
<p>According to its web site (<a href="http://www.oracleti.com/">www.oracleti.com</a>) Oracle Transcription provides medical transcription services to hospitals and medical facilities in Washington D.C. and throughout the country.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2008, disability-based charges rose to a record 19,543, up 10.2 percent from the prior year and the highest level since 1995.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the Commission is available on its web site a <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
