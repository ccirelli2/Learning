<h1>Shefa Wellness Center Sued by EEOC for  Pregnancy Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Company Violated Federal Law by Firing Pregnant Employee, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>ATLANTA - CFS Health Management Inc., d/b/a Shefa Wellness Center, a Canton, Ga., medical practice specializing in cosmetic skin care treatments, violated federal law by firing a newly hired licensed skin care therapist shortly after learning
that she was pregnant, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it recently filed.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's lawsuit, April Raines was terminated just two days after informing the company's owner of her pregnancy. At the time, Raines had only worked for the company for approximately two weeks. The agency alleges that when Raines
questioned why she was terminated, the employer told her that she had deceived the company by not disclosing her pregnancy during the interview.</p>
<p>Pregnancy discrimination violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA). The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 1:15-cv-00845-TWT-LTW) in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The federal agency seeks back pay, compensatory and punitive damages for Raines, as well as injunctive relief designed to prevent such
discrimination in the future.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
