<h1>EEOC Sues Halo Unlimited for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Company Denied Employee an Accommodation and Fired Her, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>SAN DIEGO, Calif. - Halo Unlimited, Inc., dba Infant Hearing Screening Specialists, a Corona, Calif.-based company, violated federal law when it denied an accommodation to a pregnant employee with a disability, the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), announced in a lawsuit filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's lawsuit, an infant screening technician assigned to a hospital in El Centro, Calif., was denied an accommodation for her disability by Halo Unlimited. Instead, the EEOC contends that the company fired the pregnant employee
within days of learning of her disability.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California (<em>EEOC v. Halo Unlimited, Inc. dba Infant Hearing Screening Specialists</em>, Case No.
3:17-cv-02006-H-WVG) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The EEOC's suit seeks back pay and compensa­tory damages for the employee, as well as injunctive relief intended to prevent further
discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p>"The EEOC continues to see too many companies failing to accommodate workers with disabilities," said Anna Park, regional attorney for EEOC's Los Angeles District Office, which includes Imperial County in its jurisdiction. "We encourage employers
to review their policies and procedures to make sure they are in compliance with the ADA."</p>
<p>Christopher Green, director of the EEOC's San Diego Local Office added, "This case should serve as a reminder to employers of their responsibilities to accommodate employees under federal law."</p>
<p>According to the company's website, <a href="http://www.ihssca.net">www.ihssca.net</a>, Halo Unlimited, Inc. dba Infant Hearing Screening Specialists, provides newborn hearing screening specialists in accordance with State of California standards
to over 95 medical facilities.</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employ­ment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the latest EEOC news by
