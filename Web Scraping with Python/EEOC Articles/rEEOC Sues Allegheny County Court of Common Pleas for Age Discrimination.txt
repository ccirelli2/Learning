<h1>EEOC Sues Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas for Age Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Court Fired 70-Year-Old Employee Because of Age, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>PITTSBURGH - The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Fifth Judicial District of Pennsylvania, violated federal law by firing an employee because of her age, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it
announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC, Carolyn J. Pittman, at age 70, was assigned to work at the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court by a staffing agency in February 2012. While Pittman was still in training with Lisa Moore, who was in charge of training and
supervising her, Moore complained that Pittman was too old to work in the department. On March 28, 2012, Pittman was terminated.</p>
<p>Age discrimination against employees and job applicants who are age 40 or older is a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).  The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania
Pittsburgh Division (Civil Action No. 2:14-cv-00899) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. </p>
<p>"Federal law ensures that everyone has the right to participate and advance in the workplace without discriminatory barriers," said Regional Attorney Debra Lawrence of the EEOC's Philadelphia District Office, which oversees Pennsylvania,
Delaware, West Virginia, Maryland and portions of New Jersey and Ohio. "Older workers bring invaluable experience and knowledge to the workplace which should not be overlooked by employers due to age-based stereotypes."</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the agency is available at its website, <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
