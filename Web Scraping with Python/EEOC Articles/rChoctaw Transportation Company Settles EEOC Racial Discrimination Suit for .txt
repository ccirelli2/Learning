<h1>Choctaw Transportation Company Settles EEOC Racial Discrimination Suit for $75,000</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Company Refused to Hire Blacks as Deckhands, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>MEMPHIS,  Tenn. – Choctaw Transportation Company, Inc.,  a marine construction and transportation company located in Dyersburg, Tenn.,  will pay $75,000 to an African-American job applicant to settle a racial  discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>In  its lawsuit, the EEOC charged that the company violated federal law by refusing  to hire a black job applicant for a deckhand position because of his race. The EEOC charged that Choctaw has for decades  segregated its work force and has refused to hire blacks in deckhand  positions. The EEOC further charged that  Choctaw violated the record-keeping provision of the Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA) when it failed to properly maintain medical and  personnel records.</p>
<p>Race  discrimination in hiring violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of  1964. The EEOC filed suit, No.  1:10-cv-01248-JDB-egb, in U.S. District Court for the Western District of  Tennessee, Eastern Division, after first attempting to settle the matter  through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>In  addition to monetary relief, the three-year consent decree settling the lawsuit  enjoins Choctaw Transportation from further discriminating against blacks in  hiring and requires it to use its best efforts to fill up to 25% of available  positions with African-Americans. The  consent decree further provides for training both on and off its vessels on  employee rights under Title VII, and requires Choctaw Transportation to  maintain records of discrimination complaints, provide annual reports to the  EEOC, and post a notice to employees about the lawsuit that includes the EEOC’s  contact information.</p>
<p>“Employees  should not be subjected to racial discrimination in hiring, as it is a  violation of federal law,” said Faye Williams, Regional Attorney for the EEOC’s  Memphis District Office. “The EEOC will continue to  ensure that such barriers to employment are removed.”</p>
<p>According  to company information, Choctaw Transportation operates a marine construction  and transportation company that works, in part, with the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers in the marine/barge industry.</p>
<p>The  EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is  available on its web site at  <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov.</a>.</p></div>
