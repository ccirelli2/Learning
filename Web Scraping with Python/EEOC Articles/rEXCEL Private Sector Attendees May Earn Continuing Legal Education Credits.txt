<p>WASHINGTON - We are pleased to announce that our private sector EXCEL Program has qualified for continuing legal education credits and attendees may receive recertification credits from HRCI (application pending). Also new and noteworthy will be
Commissioner Jenny Yang, the President's most recent appointment to EEOC, who will lead a panel on wage discrimination.</p>
<p>For the first time this year, the program will offer a complete, separate agenda on cutting edge developments in the private sector, which also includes state and local employees. Topics include EEOC's recent Enforcement Guidance on the Use of
Criminal Records; the seven mistakes employers make when they get a charge of discrimination, wage discrimination and more.</p>
<p>Now in its 16th year, this annual event has brought together federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), Human Resources and Alternate Dispute Resolution practitioners, members of the private bar and EEOC experts to discuss the laws and
procedures governing equal employment opportunity in the federal sector. </p>
