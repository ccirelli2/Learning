<h1>EEOC’s El Paso Office Signs Agreement with Mexican Consulate</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Federal  Agency and Consulate Will Work Together to Assist Mexican Workers in Understanding  Employment Rights</em></strong></p>
<p>EL PASO -The El Paso Office of the U.S. Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Consulate General of Mexico in El Paso.  The  agreement establishes an ongoing partnership
between the agency and the  consulate which will provide information to Mexican citizens working in the United States about their rights under federal laws that protect workers in this  country from discrimination, regardless of
documentation status.  This will include educational sessions,  Spanish-language informational materials, and training to staff about the EEOC  and the laws it enforces. </p>
<p>"The U.S. civil rights statutes give the same protection to  Mexican citizens working in the United States as they do to U.S. citizens,"  said Jeffrey Zelmanow, acting director of the EEOC's El Paso Office.  "This Memorandum of
Understanding will help  ensure that information about the law is communicated to this vulnerable  community."</p>
<p>Additionally, the EEOC will partner with the consulate to  provide information and training to areas of Texas and New Mexico where  migrant farm workers and other Mexican citizens live and work.  The EEOC's El Paso Office
covers a  geographical jurisdiction that includes west Texas and the southern counties of  New Mexico. </p>
<p>Eliminating discriminatory policies affecting vulnerable  workers who may be unaware of their rights under equal employment laws or reluctant  or unable to exercise them, are one of six national priorities identified by  the
SEP.  These policies can include  disparate pay, job segregation, harassment, and human trafficking.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces the nation's laws prohibiting employment  discrimination.  Further information  about the EEOC is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
