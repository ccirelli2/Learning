<h1>Scrap Metal Company Agrees To Settle EEOC Age Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>76-Year-Old Denied Hire Because of Age, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. – A Charlotte-area scrap metal processing company has  agreed to settle an age discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today. The EEOC had charged that Southern Metals  Company unlawfully refused to hire a 76-year-old man for a position because of  his age.</p>
<p>Southern Metals Company recycles and  processes different types of metals in the Charlotte Metro area. According to the EEOC’s complaint, Junior Revels applied for the position of diesel mechanic, for  which he was fully qualified and able to perform the duties. In spite of his qualifications, Revels was  told that Southern Metals had decided to hire someone “younger.” Thereafter, Southern Metals continued to seek  applicants for the position and eventually hired an individual who was  substantially younger and less qualified than Revels.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The EEOC filed suit (EEOC v. Southern Metals Company, Civil Action No. 3:09cv00410,  filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina) after  first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement out of court through its  conciliation process.</p>
<p>In addition to monetary damages of $10,000 for Revels, the 24-month consent decree  resolving the case includes injunctive relief enjoining the company from engaging  in further age discrimination or retaliation against those who complain about  discrimination; requires the posting of a notice about the settlement; and  requires the company to report information about discrimination complaints to  the EEOC for monitoring.</p>
<p>“The  EEOC is pleased to have resolved this case on behalf of Mr. Revels,” said  Lynette A. Barnes, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Charlotte District  Office. “Employers must remember that  older applicants are a valuable asset to the workforce, and they cannot be  denied consideration for jobs because of their age. The EEOC, as part of its mission, will  continue to enforce the rights of people age 40 and older under the ADEA.”</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal  laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the Commission is available on the agency’s web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
