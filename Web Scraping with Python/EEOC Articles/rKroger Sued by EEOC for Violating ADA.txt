<h1>Kroger Sued by EEOC for Violating ADA</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Grocery Giant Fired Cashier at Howell Store Because of Back Impairment, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>DETROIT - The Kroger Company of Michigan violated federal law by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation to an employee with a disability and then firing her, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it
filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, Kroger allowed an employee at its Howell, Mich., store, who was hired as a stock person, to work as a cashier as a reasonable accommodation. However, a few months later, after it found out her restrictions were
permanent, Kroger fired her, the EEOC said.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit (<em>EEOC v. The Kroger Company of Michigan</em>, Case No. 2:14-cv-13757) in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, after first
attempting to reach a voluntary settlement through its pre-litigation conciliation process. The EEOC seeks to recover monetary compensation for the fired employee, including back pay and compensatory damages for emotional distress, as well as
punitive damages.</p>
<p>"Federal law expressly prohibits employees from refusing to provide a reasonable accommodation to disabled employees," explained EEOC Trial Attorney Nedra Campbell. "The ADA places an affirmative duty on employers to work with employees to find
an accommodation of their restrictions."</p>
<p>The Kroger Company of Michigan is a large grocery store chain with grocery stores throughout Michigan.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
