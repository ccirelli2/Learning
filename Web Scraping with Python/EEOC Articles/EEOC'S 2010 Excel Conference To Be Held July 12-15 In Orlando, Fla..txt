<p>WASHINGTON – The U.S. Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has scheduled its 2010 Examining  Conflicts in Employment Laws (EXCEL) conference from July 12-15 at the Rosen  Shingle Creek Resort in Orlando,  Fla. The EXCEL conference – considered <em>the</em> conference to attend for senior  federal agency leaders, federal EEO and HR practitioners, and attorneys in the  federal government – provides a breadth and depth of training on the laws and  issues within the EEOC’s purview unmatched by other federal sector EEO  conferences.</p>
<p>The  13th annual EXCEL conference, under the theme "Passion for  Equality", builds on the success of the last year’s conference in New Orleans. Though the agenda is still in the planning  stages, attendees can expect a wide variety of offerings to choose from, including an “SES Track” for high level EEO Managers, an expanded “ADR Track,” a “Hearings Track” for attorneys, a “Management Directive 715 Track” for  affirmative employment professionals, a session on the new Genetic Information  Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), and multiple sessions on disability  law.</p>
<p>“I fully  expect this year’s conference to be as dynamic as the world of civil rights,”  said Carlton Hadden, Director of the EEOC’s Office of Federal Operations. “New issues are arising every day, and EEOC’s  EXCEL conference helps provide our federal community with the necessary knowledge  to meet those new challenges.”</p>
<p>Now that the date and venue are set, EEOC is ready to receive proposals for  presentations. “We are seeking proposals from civil rights leaders, EEO professionals, industry consultants,  professional speakers and trainers, and industry suppliers,” Hadden said. “If you believe you can expand the knowledge  base of the federal community, present new twists on an old idea/practice, offer  solutions to a new challenge, or address new trends, we want to hear from you!”</p>
<p>The  deadline for submitting proposals is Jan. 28.  For more information and to submit proposals, please see the <a href="https://secure.kinsail.com/results.asp?p=eeoc&amp;pt=store&amp;GroupID=14905">EEOC  Training Institute web site</a>.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting  employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
