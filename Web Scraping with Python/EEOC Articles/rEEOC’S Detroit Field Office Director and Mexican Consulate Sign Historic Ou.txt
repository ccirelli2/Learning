<h1>EEOC’S Detroit Field Office Director and Mexican Consulate Sign Historic Outreach Agreement</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Pact Establishes Ongoing Collaborative Relationship Between the Two Entities</em></strong></p>
<p>DETROIT - The Detroit Field Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Consulate of Mexico in Detroit today. The agreement establishes an ongoing collaboration between
these two entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace regardless of immigration status. Mexican Consul General Vicente Sanchez Ventura and Detroit
Field Office Director Gail D. Cober signed the agreement. The Detroit Field Office is part of the EEOC's Indianapolis District.</p>
<p>"By signing this Memorandum of Understanding today with the Mexican Consulate, the Detroit Field Office solidified our continued and longstanding commitment to an underserved community," said Cober. "This MOU provides the opportunity for ongoing
education, outreach and service by the EEOC to this community. We look forward to a long-lasting and significant partnership."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the MOU, the EEOC will expand its relationship with the Mexican Consulate by providing it with Spanish-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the federal agency. In addition, the EEOC will partner with the Consulate
to provide information and training to remote, underserved areas of the state, including the western side of Michigan, where there are more migrant farm workers.</p>
<p>To kick off the newly formed collaboration, the EEOC and the Consulate created "Anti-Discrimination Information Week." Beginning Nov. 26, the EEOC will provide visitors to the Consulate with information on the laws enforced by the EEOC,
specifically focusing on sexual harassment, national origin harassment, retaliation and Youth@Work, an EEOC campaign which deals with the problem of the sexual harassment of teenaged workers. At today's session, EEOC representatives spoke with more
than 75 people.</p>
<p>Consul Vicente Sanchez Ventura said, "I'm looking forward to working with our new friends as we provide information to our people regarding the law. We may not all speak the same language, but we do have the same purpose, and that is to stop
discrimination in the workplace."</p>
<p>The Mexican Consulate in Detroit provides services to preserve the rights of Mexican nationals residing in Michigan and Northern Ohio, much like the enforcement area of the Detroit Field Office.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
