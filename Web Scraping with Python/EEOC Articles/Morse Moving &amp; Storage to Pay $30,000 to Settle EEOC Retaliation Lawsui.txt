<h1>Morse Moving &amp; Storage to Pay $30,000 to Settle EEOC Retaliation Lawsuit</h1>

</p>
<p>DETROIT - Morse Moving &amp; Storage, a residential and corporate moving services provider based in Romulus, Mich., will pay $30,000 to settle a retaliation lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal
agency announced today. </p>
<p>EEOC's lawsuit charged that Morse Moving &amp; Storage retaliated against Latasha Black when it fired her just hours after she complained about racial harassment. </p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. EEOC filed its lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (<em>EEOC v. Morse Moving &amp; Storage, Inc</em>., Civil Case No.: 2:15-CV-13442) after
first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. </p>
<p>"EEOC is committed to enforcing anti-retaliation provisions to ensure that employees are free to exercise their rights without fear of retaliation," said Kenneth Bird, acting regional attorney for EEOC's Indianapolis District. "Morse Moving
should be commended for resolving this case early in litigation, and committing itself to complying with Title VII." </p>
<p>Eliminating policies and practices that discourage or prohibit individuals from exercising their rights under employment discrimination statutes, or that impede the EEOC's investigative or enforcement efforts, is one of six national priorities
identified by the EEOC's Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP).</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its web site at www.eeoc.gov. <br/>
