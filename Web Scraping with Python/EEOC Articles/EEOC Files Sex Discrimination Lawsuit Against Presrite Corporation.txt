<h1>EEOC Files Sex Discrimination Lawsuit Against Presrite Corporation</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Metal Forging Company Excluded Class of Women From Jobs, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>CLEVELAND – Presrite Corporation, a metal forging company with manufacturing facilities in Cleveland and Jefferson, Ohio, engaged in a pattern or practice of unlawful discrimination by refusing to hire a class of female applicants for certain jobs, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it announced today.</p>
<p>The EEOC said Presrite has rejected women for laborer and operative jobs because of their gender since at least 2005. As a result of these practices, the company violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, according to the EEOC’s lawsuit (Case No. 1:11-cv-00260) filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.</p>
<p>The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The EEOC seeks injunctive relief in its lawsuit, damages as well as lost wages and benefits and offers of employment for women who were not hired because of Presrite’s discrimination.</p>
<p>“Title VII makes sex discrimination in employment clearly and plainly illegal,” said Regional Attorney Debra Lawrence of the EEOC’s Philadelphia District Office, which oversees Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, Maryland, and portions of New Jersey and Ohio. “Employers need to be mindful of this important national policy and should be careful to avoid hiring practices that discriminate.”</p>
<p>Workplace discrimination charge filings with the federal agency nationwide rose to an unprecedented level of nearly 100,000 during fiscal year 2010.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
