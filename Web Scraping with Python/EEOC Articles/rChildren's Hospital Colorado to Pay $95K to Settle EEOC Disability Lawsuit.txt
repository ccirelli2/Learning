</div>
<p>    DENVER – Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colo., will pay $95,000 and furnish other relief to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today. </p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, Children’s discriminated against an applicant for hire due to her disability, fibromyalgia.  Cecilia McMurray applied for a staff assistant position with Colorado Children’s Healthcare Access Program in Pediatric Medicine.  After three interviews, McMurray was offered the position of staff assistant II, contingent upon the successful completion of a pre-employment health screen.  Following a medical exam arranged by Children’s, the hospital withdrew its offer of employment to McMurray.</p>
<p>Denying a job to an applicant because of a disability violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado (<em>EEOC v. Children’s Hospital Colorado</em>, Case No. 11-cv-02104-REB-CBS) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>Children’s Hospital Colorado has agreed to pay $95,000 to McMurray to resolve this case.  The hospital entered into a consent decree and agreed to ensure all employees involved in the hiring process are trained on ADA requirements.  Children’s Hospital Colorado will also report to the EEOC each time a person is denied hire due to a medical screen during the decree’s duration.</p>
<p>“The ADA is a complicated statute, and an employer’s obligations with respect to post-offer medical exams are particularly complex,” said EEOC Regional Attorney Mary Jo O’Neill.  “Employers need to be very careful when they utilize pre-employment health screens.  We applaud Children’s Hospital for taking steps to improve its hiring process to ensure that employees with disabilities are not excluded from employment.”  </p>
<p>EEOC Denver Field Office Director Nancy Sienko added, “It is important that employers give applicants with disabilities a fair shake and make employment decisions based on facts and not myths, fears or stereotypes.  We commend Children’s for ensuring its hiring decisions comply with the ADA.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
