<h1>Frankfort Restaurant Settles EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A Frankfort, Ky., restaurant has settled a pregnancy discrimination lawsuit filed by the U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, Jim’s Seafood Restaurant unlawfully fired a server because she was pregnant, and forced another pregnant server out of her job.</p>
<p>Discrimination because of pregnancy violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The EEOC filed the suit (Civil Action No. 3:10-cv-00043) in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>The parties negotiated a consent decree which provides the employees with back pay and provides for injuctive relief in the form of training and an agreement not to discriminate or retaliate further under Title VII and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</p>
<p>“As the statute makes clear, discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is sex discrimination and a violation of federal law,” said Laurie Young, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Indianapolis District Office. “We are committed to pursuing the claims of women who are denied the right to continue to work in their jobs and make a living because their employer discovered that they are pregnant.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
