<p>ATLANTA – Champion Window of Columbus, Ga., LLC violated federal law when it fired an employee because of his age, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, Civ. Action No.4:10-cv-00080-CDL., filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, Champion Window fired Installation Manager Ronald Henderson, 56, because of his age. A top manager reportedly issued an order that Henderson be fired and “someone young and energetic” be hired in his place, the EEOC said. Further, the agency said that the employer had Henderson train his much younger replacement just prior to his own discharge.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement. The EEOC is seeking back pay, liquidated damages and reinstatement for Henderson. The lawsuit also seeks injunctive relief designed to stop the discrimination and prevent it from recurring in the future.</p>
<p>According to company information, Champion Window of Columbus, Ga., LLC is a subsidiary of Champion Retailco, LLC, and an affiliate of Champion Window Manufacturing &amp; Supply Company, LLC, which has 71 stores across the country. Champion Window is in the business of selling and installing windows, doors, vinyl siding and patio rooms to residential property owners.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
