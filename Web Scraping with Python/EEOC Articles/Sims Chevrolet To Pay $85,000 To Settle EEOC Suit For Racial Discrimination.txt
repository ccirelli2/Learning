<h1>Sims Chevrolet To Pay $85,000 To Settle EEOC Suit For Racial Discrimination And Retaliation</h1>

<p>CLEVELAND – Andy Chevrolet, doing  business as Sims Chevrolet, a Cleveland  automobile dealership, will pay $85,000  and furnish other relief to settle a race discrimination and retalia­tion lawsuit, the U.S. Equal Employ­ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, the EEOC charged that since July 2007, Sims Chevrolet subjected a class of African Americans to different terms and conditions of employment and a hostile work environment on  the basis of race. The federal agency alleged that the discriminatory conduct included racial epithets, such as repeated use of the N-word, and also involved management making sales team assignments based upon race. Additionally, the EEOC claimed  that Sims retaliated against one of the individuals after he complained about the unlawful discrimination by withholding his wages.</p>
<p>Racial discrimination and  retaliation for complaining about it violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio after first attempt­ing to  reach a settlement out of court (<em>EEOC v. Andy  Chevrolet Company dba Sims Chevrolet</em>, 1:08-cv-02335).</p>
<p>The three-year consent decree  settling the suit provides for a monetary settlement of $85,000 to five discrimination  victims. In addition to monetary relief,  the decree provides for significant remedial relief, including revising the  company’s non-discrimination and anti-harassment policies and complaint  procedures; promoting supervisor responsibility and accountability; and  requiring yearly anti-discrimination training.</p>
<p>EEOC Acting Regional Attorney Debra  M. Lawrence of the Philadelphia District Office, which oversees parts of Ohio, said, “This case  of discrimination could have been avoided if the employer had followed Title  VII requirements. Even so, the  settlement should be a reminder to all employers of their obligations under the  statute.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
