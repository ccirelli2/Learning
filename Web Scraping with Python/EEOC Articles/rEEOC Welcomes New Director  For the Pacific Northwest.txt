<p>SEATTLE -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) this week welcomed Nancy A. Sienko as the new director of the agency's Seattle Field Office, with jurisdiction over the states of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Montana and
Washington.</p>
<p>Throughout her 35-year tenure with the EEOC, Sienko has demonstrated a strong commitment to enforcement, education, and partnership. Sienko began her career at the EEOC as an investigator in the Milwaukee office, and has served the agency in a
variety of positions, most recently as director of the EEOC's Denver Field Office since April 2006. Extremely active in outreach activities, she has served on several boards and committees, including a three-year term as an executive director with
the Denver Federal Executive Board.</p>
<p>"I am delighted to join the EEOC Seattle Field Office team in carrying forward the legacy of the civil rights movement at such a meaningful time," said Sienko, who reported to the Seattle Office at the start of the federal fiscal new year in
October. "The year 2015 will mark the EEOC's 50th anniversary, which was established one year after the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. So I am happy to lead the agency's work in the Pacific Northwest at such an auspicious but challenging
time."</p>
<p>Michael Baldonado, director of the EEOC's San Francisco District, which includes the Seattle Field Office, said, "As Seattle Field Office director, Nancy's quality, talents, and unique experience will be a great asset to the agency. She is an
outstanding manager and leader, and we are glad to have her take the helm in fighting discrimination and championing equal opportunity throughout that important region."</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information about the agency is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
