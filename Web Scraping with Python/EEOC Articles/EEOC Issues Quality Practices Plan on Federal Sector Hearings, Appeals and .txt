<h1>EEOC Issues Quality Practices Plan on Federal Sector Hearings, Appeals and Oversight Functions</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today published <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/federal/quality-practices.cfm">Federal Sector Quality Practices</a> (FSQP) to address the quality of the agency's hearings and
appeals in federal employee employment discrimination complaints. The FSQP also devotes attention to the Commission's role in providing oversight of federal agencies when reviewing affirmative employment and barrier analysis plans, evaluating
federal agency complaint processes, and offering technical assistance to federal agencies. It is modeled on the private sector's Quality Practices for Effective Investigations and Conciliations (QEP), created pursuant to EEOC's Strategic Enforcement
Plan.</p>
<p>The FSQP was developed by an internal work group, appointed by Chair Jenny R. Yang, that surveyed the workforce to gather information on the hallmarks of quality work and studied commentary on the federal sector, including reviewing General
Accountability Office reports; testimony from past Commission meetings; public comments and letters from stakeholders suggesting improvements for federal sector processing. The work group's efforts were refined, and ultimately unanimously approved,
by EEOC's Commissioners.</p>
<p>"These Federal Sector Quality Practices provide guidelines to help our staff strengthen our federal employee hearings and appeals process, timely resolve complaints, and provide valuable oversight to agencies in their EEO programs," said Chair
Jenny R. Yang.  "This document is a tool to ensure EEOC provides a high-quality work product to its federal sector stakeholders." </p>
<p>EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employ­ment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the latest EEOC news by subscribing
