<p>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - The Birmingham District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Consulate of Mexico in Atlanta on April 17. The agreement establishes an ongoing
collaborative relationship between these two entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace, regardless of documentation status. Ricardo Camara Sánchez,
Consul General of Mexico in Atlanta, and Delner Franklin-Thomas, director of the Birmingham District, will sign the agreement.</p>
<p>The Mexican Consulate in Atlanta provides services to preserve the rights of Mexican nationals residing in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee's 74 eastern counties. The EEOC's Birmingham District includes Alabama, Mississippi (except 17 northern
counties) and the Florida Panhandle.</p>
<p>"A Memorandum of Understanding promotes employment justice and allows us to continue current practices which are in place," said District Director Franklin-Thomas.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the MOU, the EEOC will expand its cooperation with the Mexican Consulate, providing it with Spanish-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the EEOC. The EEOC will also provide representatives to meet with Mexican
nationals in Alabama in order to disseminate information and conduct counseling regarding employment discrimination matters.</p>
<p>The EEOC and the Mexican Consulate will work together regularly to provide information regarding workplace discrimination on Spanish-language radio stations throughout their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The EEOC is the federal agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
