<h1>EEOC Sues Allegiance Industries for Gender Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Female Supervisor Fired by District Manager Who Wanted a Man in Her Position, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>ATLANTA – Allegiance Industries, Inc., a cleaning service with work sites throughout the Atlanta area, violated federal law when it fired a female supervisor because of her sex, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, Civil Action No., 110-CV-1260, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Brenda Lowery was hired by Allegiance Industries in or around January 2009 as a cleaning team supervisor. Lowery’s cleaning team was assigned to work at an Arthritis Foundation of Georgia work site. According to the EEOC, on several occasions throughout her employment, Allegiance Industries’ district manager told Lowery that he wanted a male supervisor at the Arthritis Foundation work site. On or around July 1, 2009, the district manager ultimately terminated Lowery, the EEOC said, and again told her that he needed a man on the contract. Immediately after Lowery was fired, Allegiance Industries placed a male supervisor at that work site.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement. The EEOC is seeking back pay, compensatory and punitive damages for Lowery. The lawsuit also seeks injunctive relief designed to stop the sex discrimination and prevent it from recurring in the future.</p>
<p>“This is a case where there is clear and direct evidence of intentional sex discrimination,” said Robert K. Dawkins, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Atlanta District Office. “It highlights the importance of the EEOC’s obligation to protect the rights of employees.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
