<h1>Stanley Martin Companies, LLC Sued By EEOC For Pay Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Female Purchasing Manager Was Paid Less Than Males in the Same Position, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Stanley Martin Companies, LLC, one of the largest homebuilders in the Mid-Atlantic Region, violated federal law by failing to promote a qualified female employee to a purchasing manager position and then paid her less than her male
coworkers after promoting her, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit announced today.</p>
<p>EEOC alleged Carrie Smith began working as a budget analyst at Stanley Martin's office in Reston, Va., in January 2013. After being hired, Stanley Martin assigned Smith to perform purchasing manager duties but would not pay her the same salary
paid to male purchasing managers or promote her to the position. When Stanley Martin finally promoted Smith to the purchasing manager position, she was paid less than the male purchasing managers.</p>
<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on sex, including pay discrimination and in making promotion decisions. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 also prohibits compensation discrimination based on sex. EEOC first
attempted to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process before filing suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division (<em>EEOC v. Stanley Martin Companies, LLC</em>, Civil Action
No. 1:15-cv-01246-AJT-IDD).</p>
<p>Washington Field Office Acting Director Mindy Weinstein said, "Unfortunately, pay discrimination remains a serious problem in the workplace. The Commission will take strong action to eradicate gender-based pay disparities and other gender-based
barriers to equal employment opportunity."</p>
<p>"Ms. Smith was doing equal work and had the same job responsibilities as the male purchasing managers, so she was entitled to equal pay," said EEOC Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence.</p>
<p>Enforcement of equal pay laws and targeting compensation systems and practices that discriminate based on gender is of one of six national priorities identified by EEOC's Strategic Enforcement Plan.</p>
<p>EEOC's Washington Field Office has jurisdiction over the District of Columbia and the State of Virginia counties of Arlington, Clarke, Fairfax, Fauquier, Frederick, Loudoun, Prince William, Stafford and Warren, and the State of Virginia
independent cities of Alexandria, Fairfax City, Falls Church, Manassas, Manassas Park and Winchester.</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the agency is available at its website, <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
