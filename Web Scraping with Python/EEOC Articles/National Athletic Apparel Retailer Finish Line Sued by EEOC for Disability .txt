<h1>National Athletic Apparel Retailer Finish Line Sued by EEOC for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Company Fired Employee Because of Shoulder Injury, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>INDIANAPOLIS – Indianapolis-headquartered retailer Finish Line, Inc., a nationwide athletic apparel retailer, violated federal law by firing an employee because of a physical disability, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, Finish Line failed to select Emma Armon, who has a physical impairment related to a right shoulder injury, when she sought to transfer to an available customer service representative position as a reasonable accommodation to her disability. Instead, the EEOC charged, Finish Line discharged her in favor of equally or less qualified individuals.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No.1:10-c v-1686-JMS-MJD) in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement. In its suit, the EEOC seeks back pay as well as compensatory and punitive damages for Armon, and injunctive relief.</p>
<p>“Treating an employee badly based on a physical impairment violates the very core of the ADA,” said EEOC Indianapolis District Office Regional Attorney Laurie Young. “The EEOC will continue to fight for the rights of disability discrimination victims.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency’s web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
