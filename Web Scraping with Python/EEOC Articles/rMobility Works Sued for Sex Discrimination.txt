<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Employer Fired Top Sales Associate Because of Her Sex, says EEOC </strong></em></p>
<p>SAGINAW-The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit today against Akron, Ohio based WMK, Inc. d/b/a Mobility Works for discharging a top female sales associate at the Saginaw, Michigan store. The EEOC alleged in its suit
that Mobility Works violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by firing Pamela Miller because of her sex.</p>
<p>EEOC Regional Attorney Laurie Young said, "The Commission will continue to take action against companies that ignore Title VII and consider sex in employment decisions." According to EEOC Trial Attorney Nedra Campbell, "Among other facts, the
sales records suggested that Miller should have been retained over her male counterparts because she had higher sales." </p>
<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion, or national origin. The EEOC filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (Case No.
1:12-cv-15588).</p>
<p>W.M.K., Inc. d/b/a Mobility Works, headquartered in Akron, Ohio, provides vans for wheelchair users. Mobility Works has 14 retail stores located in 7 states, including the Saginaw, Michigan store where Miller worked. Mobility Works is reportedly
one of the largest accessible-vehicle suppliers in the country. </p>
<p>The EEOC is the federal agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
