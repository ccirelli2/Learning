</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Agreement Establishes an Ongoing Collaborative Relationship Between the Two Entities</strong></em></p>
<p>DENVER -- The Denver Field Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Consulate of Mexico in Denver today.  The agreement establishes an ongoing collaborative
relationship between these two entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace, regardless of documentation status.  Mexican Consul General Andrés
Chao and Rayford O. Irvin, director of the EEOC's Phoenix District Office, signed the agreement.</p>
<p>The Mexican Consulate in Denver provides services to preserve the rights of Mexican nationals residing in Colorado and Wyoming.  The EEOC's Phoenix District Office enforces federal employment discrimination laws and has jurisdiction over the
states of Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and parts of New Mexico.  </p>
<p>"A Memorandum of Understanding promotes employment justice and allows us to continue current practices which are in place," said Irvin. </p>
<p>Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the EEOC will expand its cooperation with the Mexican Consulate. The federal agency will provide the Consulate with Spanish-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the EEOC.  The
agency will also provide representatives to meet with Mexican nationals in Colorado and Wyoming in order to disseminate information and conduct counseling regarding employment discrimination matters.</p>
<p>The EEOC and the Mexican Consulate will work together to regularly provide information regarding workplace discrimination on Spanish-language radio stations throughout their respective jurisdictions. </p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment. <br/>
Further information about the agency is available by calling 1-800-669-4000 and on its website at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
