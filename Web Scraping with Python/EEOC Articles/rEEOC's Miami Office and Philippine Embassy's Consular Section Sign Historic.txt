</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Pact Establishes Ongoing Collaborative Relationship between the Two Entities</strong></em></p>
<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The Miami District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the consular section of the Philippine embassy of Washington, D.C. in Fort Lauderdale
today.  The agreement establishes an ongoing collaboration between these entities to provide Philippine nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace regardless of immigration
status.  Philippine First Secretary and Consul Arlene Tullid-Magno, on behalf of Minister and Consul General Emil T. Fernandez, and EEOC Miami District Office Director Malcolm S. Medley signed the agreement.  </p>
<p>"By signing this Memorandum of Understanding today with the embassy's consular section, the EEOC Miami District Office solidified our continued and longstanding commitment to this underserved community," said Medley.  "I am also extremely
pleased that we are able to enter into an agreement which will further our efforts to reach Philippine nationals throughout the state of Florida.  This Memorandum of Understanding provides the opportunity for the EEOC to continue with ongoing
education, outreach and service.  We look forward to a long-lasting and significant partnership."</p>
<p>Tullid-Magno said, "We are fortunate to be able to work with a government that shares our principles and belief in the dignity and worth of human beings, regardless of their status in life.  This is a partnership the Philippine embassy is
eager to cultivate for the benefit of our working population in this country and we are thankful for the opportunity to do so and excited at the prospects that lie ahead.  We are certainly pleased to sign our first EEOC local alliance with the
Miami District Office, which has been at the forefront of our local engagement and outreach efforts in the Southeastern states over which the embassy has consular jurisdiction."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the EEOC will expand its relationship with the embassy's consular section by providing it with materials explaining the laws enforced by the federal agency.  In addition, the EEOC will
provide information and training in areas of the state where Philippine nationals live and work.  </p>
<p>The Miami District Office is comprised of the Miami, Tampa and San Juan EEOC offices, and has jurisdiction over Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The EEOC Miami District and Tampa Field Offices have established significant
partnership efforts by providing information and counseling to individuals on the laws EEOC enforces by visiting mobile consular outreach events sponsored throughout Florida by the embassy's consular section.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination.  Further information is available at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
