<h1>EEOC to Join Other Government Agencies in Baton Rouge Town Hall Meeting on Employment Issues</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Experts Will Help Public With Job-Related Problems at Nov. 5 Event</em></strong></p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS -- Representatives of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will join several other governmental agencies in a Nov. 5 Baton Rouge public town hall meeting to educate and assist the public on employment issues and problems.</p>
<p>The EEOC will join with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Louisiana Commission on Human Rights (LCHR) to discuss employment concerns at the event. People who believe they have been victims of employment discrimination based on race, sex, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, wages, work conditions, pregnancy or public accommodations are invited to attend.</p>
<p>The event will take place on Saturday, Nov. 5, 2011, 9:30 am – 12:00 pm, at the Southern University Law School, 2 Roosevelt Steptoe Drive, Room 129, A.A. Lenoir Hall, Baton Rouge.</p>
<p>This event is one of many being scheduled throughout the state where federal and state agencies will collaborate in their efforts to meet the citizens and discuss their employment concerns. Reaching more people through non-traditional outreach and information sharing will aid the agencies in maximizing their resources to assist workers in resolving issues before they escalate into intractable conflict. These federal and state agencies want to promote healthy workplaces through education and knowledge.</p>
<p>The event is free and open to the public, and no registration is required. Additional information regarding this event may be obtained by contacting EEOC Outreach Program Manager Tydell N. Whitfield at 504-595-2838 or <a href="mailto:tydell.whitfield@eeoc.gov" id="mailto:tydell.whitfield@eeoc.gov|">tydell.whitfield@eeoc.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The EEOC is the federal agency which enforces anti-discrimination laws in employment. The NLRB protects the rights of employees to join together, with or without a union, to improve their wages and working conditions. OSHA sets and enforces protective workplace safety and health standards. The LCHR enforces Louisiana laws that prohibit various forms of discrimination related to employment, public accommodations and banking and lending practices.</p>
