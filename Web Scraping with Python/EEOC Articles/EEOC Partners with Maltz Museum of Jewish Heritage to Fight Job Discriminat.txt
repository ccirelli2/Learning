</div>
<div align="left"><p>CLEVELAND - The Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) are teaming up to help employees file employment discrimination complaints, the federal agency announced today.  On the last Thursday of each month, beginning February 25, 2010, from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm, EEOC personnel will be available at the Maltz Museum, 2929 Richmond Road in Beachwood, to talk with individuals who have employment discrimination concerns and to complete the necessary forms to initiate a charge of discrimination.  <br/>
<br/>
The Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage advocates a tolerance and understanding of people of all religions, races, cultures and ethnic backgrounds and serves as an educational resource for Northeast Ohio's Jewish and general communities.  The EEOC promotes equality of opportunity in the workplace and enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  <br/>
<br/>
“It’s a good partnership for us and for the community,” said Daniel Cabot, director of the EEOC’s Cleveland Field Office.  <br/>
<br/>
The EEOC’s expanded presence will repeat the last Thursday of each month, from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm.  For more information on filing a charge of discrimination or to schedule an appointment with an EEOC representative, please call Sabrina Shifman at (216) 522-7680.  <br/>
