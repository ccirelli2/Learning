<h1>Warren Tricomi to Pay $30,000 to Settle EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination Suit</h1>

<p>NEW YORK – Warren Tricomi, a New York-based hair salon with locations in the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan and in Greenwich, Conn., will pay $30,000 and provide a positive employee reference to settle a pregnancy discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, filed on Sept. 29, 2011 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Civil Action No. 11 Civ. 6837), the EEOC charged that Warren Tricomi rescinded an employee’s promotion from assistant colorist to colorist and fired her soon after she informed the company that she was pregnant.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), which prohibits employers from subjecting employees to discrimination based on pregnancy. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>In addition to monetary relief, the consent decree settling the suit requires that Warren Tricomi issue a positive job reference to the fired employee and provide training on laws prohibiting employment discrimination. The company will also distribute and post an anti-discrimination policy and a notice about the lawsuit and settlement at its salon locations. Warren Tricomi must also make available to the EEOC all employee complaints of sex and/or pregnancy discrimination.</p>
<p>“Employment decisions cannot be made on the basis of pregnancy,” said Elizabeth Grossman, regional attorney of the EEOC’s New York District Office. “The EEOC will continue to bring cases like these to remind employers that doing so is a violation of the law.”</p>
<p>Ana Consuelo Martinez, trial attorney in the New York District Office, added, “Awareness of the PDA is important for both employers and employees, especially in fields with a large percentage of young women who are balancing their careers with their desire to start a family.”</p>
<p>The EEOC is the government agency responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment. Further information about the EEOC is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
