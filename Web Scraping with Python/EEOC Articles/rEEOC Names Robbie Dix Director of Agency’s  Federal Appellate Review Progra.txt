<p>Dix has served as Acting Director of Appellate Review Programs, a critical component of EEOC's Office of Federal Operations (OFO).</p>
<p>"This is a significant step forward," said Yang. "The Appellate Review Programs is a critical and essential component to the Commission's overall enforcement of civil rights laws. Robbie's wealth of experience and steadfast commitment to a
vigorous enforcement of those laws is invaluable; he is perfectly suited to lead the Appellate Review Programs."</p>
<p>Dix said, "I am deeply honored by the opportunity Chair Yang has afforded me. I thank her for entrusting me with the responsibility to direct the adjudicatory aspect of the Commission's pursuit of equal employment opportunity in the federal
government. While tremendous progress has been made, I look forward to implementing the Commission's vision of a timely, efficacious, and outstanding appellate program."</p>
<p>During his tenure at EEOC, Dix has served in a wide array of leadership positions, including Acting Director of the Appellate Review Programs, Director of the Review Division, Acting Director, Office of Equal Employment Opportunity; Acting
Director, Office of Review and Appeals and Senior Trial Attorney, Systemic Programs, Office of General Counsel. He also was appointed by former EEOC Chair Jacqueline Berrien to serve on the Strategic Enforcement Plan Work Group, which established
the priorities which were ultimately approved by the Commission.</p>
<p>OFO Director Carlton Hadden said, "I am grateful that Robbie Dix will lead our work in the Appellate Review Programs. He is a visionary leader who will be a key player in moving the federal government forward to achieving a real model EEO
status."</p>
<p>OFO provides leadership and guidance to federal agencies on the federal government's equal employment opportunity (EEO programs); develops and implements Commission-approved affirmative employment policies; assures federal agency compliance with
Commission regulations which establish systems for the fair adjudication of discrimination complaints; and administers the appeals process for the federal sector. As well, it provides guidance and leadership for all other Commission activities to
effect government-wide EEO processes and programs.</p>
