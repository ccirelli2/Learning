<h1>EEOC Issues FY 2017 Performance Report</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) made significant progress in managing the pending inventory of charges during fiscal year 2017, which ended Sept. 30, the agency reported in its annual <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/upload/2017par.pdf">Performance and Accountability Report</a> published on Nov. 15.</p>
<p>EEOC offices deployed new strategies to more efficiently prioritize charges with merit and more quickly resolve investigations once the agency had sufficient information. Together with improvements in the agency's digital systems, these
strategies produced an increase in charge resolutions and a significant decrease in charge inventory. As a result, in fiscal year 2017 the EEOC resolved 99,109 charges and reduced the charge workload by 16.2 percent to 61,621, the lowest level of
inventory in 10 years. Additionally, during the fiscal year, the EEOC handled over 540,000 calls to the toll-free number and more than 155,000 contacts about possible charge filing in field offices, resulting in 84,254 charges being filed. </p>
<p>"The pending inventory of private sector charges (the backlog) has been a longstanding issue for the EEOC and the public it serves," said EEOC Acting Chair Victoria A. Lipnic. "Early in the calendar year, we made addressing the backlog a
priority. A primary point of this effort was to share strategies among our offices that have been particularly effective in dealing with the pending inventory, while ensuring we are capturing charges with merit. I thank EEOC's employees for their
work and congratulate them on this progress."</p>
<p>Other fiscal year 2017 highlights include:</p>
<p>The EEOC secured approximately $484 million for victims of discrimination in the workplace. This includes $355.6 million in monetary relief for those who work in the private sector and state and local government workplaces through mediation,
conciliation and other administrative enforcement, and $42.4 million in monetary relief for charging parties through litigation. The EEOC also secured $86 million in monetary relief for federal employees and applicants. Importantly, in each of these
categories, the agency obtained substantial changes to discriminatory practices to remedy violations of equal employment opportunity laws and prevent future discriminatory conduct.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2017, the EEOC filed 184 merits lawsuits, including 124 suits on behalf of individuals, <a id="_Hlk495649324" name="_Hlk495649324">30 non-systemic suits with multiple victims, and 30 systemic suits.</a> This is more than double the
number of suits filed in fiscal year 2016. Additionally, EEOC's legal staff resolved 109 merits lawsuits for a total monetary recovery of $42.4 million and achieved a favorable result in 91 percent of all district court resolutions. In addition, a
number of very significant suits were successfully resolved.</p>
<p>The agency's outreach programs reached 317,000 people during the year through participation in more than 4,000 no-cost educational, training and outreach events. The EEOC continued to promote the online <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/smallbusiness/index.cfm">Small Business Resource Center</a> to provide a one-stop shop to help small businesses easily access information about employer responsibilities. The Small Business Administration Ombudsman's
Report again gave EEOC an "A" rating for responsiveness to small business concerns.</p>
<p>On the technology front, the agency further enhanced its online capabilities for the public and made internal operational improvements. For the public, the EEOC advanced its online services by way of a pilot program which allowed individuals in
five EEOC offices to submit inquiries online, schedule interviews, and submit and receive charge information. This pilot led to the nationwide launch of the <a href="https://publicportal.eeoc.gov/portal/">EEOC Public Portal</a> in November 2017.
Internally, the agency replaced many paper procedures with more efficient online tools.</p>
<p>In our federal sector program, the agency resolved 6,661 hearings complaints and secured more than $72.7 million in relief for federal employees. EEOC also resolved 4,284 appeals of agency decisions on federal sector complaints, a 14 percent
increase over the previous year, including 47.3 percent of them within 180 days of receipt, and secured more than $13.3 million in relief. Our federal program also reduced its pending inventory of appeals by 11 percent to 3,658 the lowest level in
nine years.</p>
