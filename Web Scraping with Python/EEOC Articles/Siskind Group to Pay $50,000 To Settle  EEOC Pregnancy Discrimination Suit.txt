<h1>Siskind Group to Pay $50,000 To Settle  EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination Suit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>New York City-Based Apparel Company Fired Employee Rather Than Allow Her to Return to Work After Childbirth, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>NEW YORK - Manhattan-based apparel company R. Siskind &amp; Company, Inc., doing business as Siskind Group, will pay $50,000 and implement revised anti-discrimination policies and procedures to settle a pregnancy discrimination lawsuit filed by
the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's lawsuit, Siskind Group fired a customer service employee because of her pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions that included the effects of an emergency caesarean section. Although Siskind Group purported to
grant the employee maternity leave, when she tried to return to work, she was informed that she no longer had a position for reasons that the EEOC said were pretexts for discrimination.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which prohibits employers from discriminating based on pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions. The EEOC filed
suit in July in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (<em>EEOC v. R. Siskind &amp; Company, Inc.</em>, Civil Action No. 17-cv-5175), after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation
process.</p>
<p>The consent decree resolving the suit was entered by U.S. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest on Nov. 27. It provides that Siskind pay $50,000 in lost wages and damages to the former employee. The decree also requires multiple steps to prevent
future discrimination, including anti-discrimination policies, training, and leave and accommodation procedures, which will be monitored by the EEOC for three years.</p>
<p>"We are pleased that because of this settlement, Siskind Group will institute policies and provide training so that its management will better recognize and protect the rights of women in the workplace going forward," said EEOC Regional Attorney
Jeffrey Burstein.</p>
<p>EEOC New York District Director Kevin Berry added, "This case exemplifies the EEOC's commitment to enforcing the law's protections for women in the workplace, including pregnancy and childbirth."</p>
<p>The EEOC's New York District Office is responsible for processing discrimination charges, administrative enforcement and the conduct of agency litigation in New York, northern New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New
Hampshire and Maine.</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the
