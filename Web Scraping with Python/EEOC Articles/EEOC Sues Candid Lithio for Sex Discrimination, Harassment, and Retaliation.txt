<h1>EEOC Sues Candid Lithio for Sex Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Female Employee Subjected to Sex Discrimination and Discharged Along with Co-Workers Associated with Her, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>LAS VEGAS - Candid Lithio, a creative design services company violated federal law when they subjected a female employee to sex discrimination, sexual harassment, retaliation, and discharged employees who associated with her, the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's lawsuit, Candid Lithio's general manager subjected a female production manager to regular and continuous sexual discrimination and harassment at the New York-based company's Las Vegas location. The EEOC contends that after
the production manager complained to human resources officials regarding this treatment, the company fired her. The EEOC further asserts that the company discharged the employee's son and fiancé without justification on the same day.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates prohibitions against sex discrimination, sexual harassment and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed its suit against Candid Lithio in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Nevada (EEOC v. Candid Lithio DBA Candid Worldwide, Case No. 2:17-cv-02119 ), after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The EEOC's suit seeks back pay, benefits and punitive damages for these three
former employees, as well as injunctive relief intended to prevent Candid Lithio from engaging in further discrimination.</p>
<p>"Sex discrimination and retaliation continue to be common problems in the workplace," said Anna Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles District, which includes Nevada in its jurisdiction. "The Commission remains committed to
eradicating these forms of employment discrimination."</p>
<p>Christine Park-Gonzalez, acting local director of the EEOC's Las Vegas Local Office, added, "Harassment allegations still account for a significant number of charges filed with the EEOC. Employers should review their policies and practices to
ensure they are in compliance with federal anti-harassment laws."</p>
<p>According to the company's website, <a href="http://www.candidww.com">www.candidww.com</a>, the New York-based company provides creative design services including corporate branding billboards, wall coverings, vehicle wraps, and package design.
Candid Worldwide was created after the company's expansion to Las Vegas in 2013.</p>
