<h1>Patton Archery Settles EEOC Sexual Harassment Lawsuit</h1>

<p><em><strong>Owner Fostered Sexually Hostile Work Environment, Federal Agency Charged</strong></em></p>
<p align="left">DETROIT -- Patton Archery Manufacturing, Inc., a former manufacturer of archery components in Vulcan, Mich., has agreed to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for $21,000 and other relief, the agency announced today.</p>
</div>
<p>The EEOC’s lawsuit, Case No. 2:09:CV-205 in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, charged that the owner of Patton Archery subjected three female bow sanders, Brenda Maynard, Julie Roberts and Leslie Querio, to a sexually hostile work environment.  The misconduct ranged from telling and disseminating detailed sexual jokes to bold and unwanted physical touching, the EEOC said.  </p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights of 1964, which prohibits sexual harassment.  The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. </p>
<p>Under the terms of the three-year consent decree, signed by U.S. District Judge Robert Holmes Bell, Patton Archery will pay the three women $21,000 and will be prohibited from engaging in any further employment practice that discriminates against an employee on the basis of sex.  Patton Archery will also be prohibited from retaliating against any employees for filing a charge of discrimination or participating in the investigation of any charge of discrimination.  </p>
<p>“Although the company closed after the EEOC filed its lawsuit, we continued to pursue this case because these three women were harmed and were entitled to relief,” said EEOC Trial Attorney Trek Carethers.  “Companies cannot escape liability for their wrongdoing by closing their doors.  We’re very pleased that we were able to amicably resolve this case with the company.”</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing the nation’s laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov.    <br/>
