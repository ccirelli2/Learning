<h1>Meat Market San Juan Agrees to Conciliate EEOC Age Discrimination Investigation</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>SAN JUAN, P.R. - Meat Market San Juan, LLC, a steakhouse in San Juan, P.R., has agreed to pay a monetary amount to unsuccessful job applicants and to maintain a workplace free of discrimination to resolve an age discrimination investigation by
the San Juan Local Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today.</p>
<p>The agreement, a voluntary resolution, results from a multi-year EEOC investigation into Meat Market's hiring and recruitment practices. As part of the agreement, Meat Market agreed to maintain a policy of hiring candidates without regard to
their age.</p>
<p>Meat Market San Juan, LLC denied the allegations of the investigation but agreed to conciliate the matter with the EEOC. The parties have reached a resolution stipulating that Meat Market will take affirmative steps to institute new hiring and
recruitment policies and put in place measures aimed at ensuring that age does not factor into hiring decisions in the future.</p>
<p>"We appreciate that Meat Market worked cooperatively with the EEOC to resolve this charge," said William Sanchez, director of the EEOC's San Juan Local Office. "This agreement ensures that the company will take proactive measures to prevent
discrimination in the future by putting in place effective recruitment and hiring practices."</p>
<p>The San Juan Local Office is part of the EEOC's Miami District. The Miami District is responsible for investigating charges of discrimination in the State of Florida, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the
