<p>SEATTLE -- The San Francisco District Office  of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) signed a Memorandum  of Understanding with the Consul of Mexico in Seattle today.  The agreement establishes a
partnership  between the agency and the consulate which will provide information to Mexican  citizens working in the United States about their rights under federal laws  that protect workers in this country from discrimination,
regardless of  documentation status.</p>
<p>Mexican Consul Eduardo Baca Cuenca and  Michael Baldonado, director of the EEOC's San Francisco District Office, signed  the agreement.  Under its terms, the EEOC  and the Mexican consulate will work together to regularly
provide information  regarding workplace discrimination and harassment through joint educational  sessions to workers throughout their respective juris­dictions.  They will distribute Spanish-language  materials explaining the
laws enforced by the EEOC, and conduct training to  consulate staff about the EEOCand the laws it enforces.</p>
<p>"Protecting immigrant, migrant and other  vulnerable workers, who may be unaware of their rights under equal employment  laws, is one of six national priorities identified by the EEOC's Strategic  Enforcement Plan," said
Baldonado.  "We  are honored to work together with the Consulate of Mexico to advance everyone's  rights against discrimination."</p>
