<h1>EEOC and Sherman Howard L.L.C. Conciliate Sexual and Gender Discrimination Charge</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Firm Implemented Remedial Measures When Allegations Came To Light</em></strong></p>
<p>DENVER - A former assistant in one of the offices of the regional law firm of Sherman &amp; Howard L.L.C. filed a charge of discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Denver Field Office. The charge contained
allegations of sexual harassment and gender discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.</p>
<p>The firm undertook an internal investigation and implemented remedial measures when the allegations came to light. Upon receipt of the charge, the EEOC conducted a separate investigation and determined that a violation of Title VII occurred. The
firm cooperated with the EEOC investigation fully. The firm has denied any wrongdoing or liability, but has agreed to an end relief that has been allocated to back pay and compensatory damages at the request of the charging party. The firm has also
agreed to continue its recurring sexual harassment training to its workforce.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces the federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at  <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a></p></div>
