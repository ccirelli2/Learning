<h1>Arbonne International to Pay $30,000 To Settle EEOC Disability Discrimination Suit</h1>

<p>INDIANAPOLIS – A large skin care products company with a distribution center in Greenwood, Ind., will pay $30,000 to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today. </p>
<p>The EEOC charged in its suit (Case no. 1:09-CV-0354-LJM-TAB in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division) that Arbonne International LLC violated federal law by refusing to hire Lisa Wilson due to her disability (deafness). </p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement.</p>
<p>In addition to the monetary settlement, the 18-month consent decree provides for Arbonne to comply with prohibitions against further discrimination, post and distribute a policy of non-discrimination, train its employees and report to the EEOC.</p>
<p>EEOC Regional Attorney Laurie Young noted, “The ADA was passed to protect applicants like Lisa Wilson who are willing and able to work but are discriminated against by employers who may have false perceptions about disabilities.”</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
