<h1>Care Manor Nursing and Rehab Center Settles  EEOC Retaliation Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Arkansas Nursing Home Fired Employee in Retaliation for Her Complaining About Its Hiring An Accused Sexual Harasser, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>MOUNTAIN HOME, Ark. - Care Manor Nursing and Rehab Center in Mountain Home, Ark., will pay $22,500 to a former employee and furnish other relief to settle a lawsuit for retaliation filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC),
the federal agency announced today.</p>
<p>The EEOC's suit charged Care Manor with violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it fired an employee in retaliation for her protest over the hire of an employee who, she said, had sexually harassed her at another facility.</p>
<p>Retaliation for opposing discriminatory conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 3:11-CV-03089-PKH) in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, Harrison Division, after
first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>In addition to the monetary relief, the consent decree settling the suit, approved by U. S. District Judge P.K. Holmes, requires Care Manor to provide training to its personnel on sexual harassment and retaliation; submit reports to EEOC during
the decree's 18-month period; and post a notice reinforcing the company's policies on Title VII and its procedures for reporting and preventing discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p>"Retaliation continues to be a problem across the country and within the Memphis District," said Regional Attorney Faye A. Williams of the EEOC's Memphis District Office, which has jurisdiction over Arkansas, Tennessee and portions of
Mississippi. "Employees have a right to complain about discrimination in the workplace, and the EEOC remains committed to combating retaliation."</p>
<p>CMNRC, Inc. is based in Melbourne, Ark. Care Manor Nursing and Rehab Center provides long-term care and short-term rehabilitation services to patients.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
