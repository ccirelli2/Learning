</div>
<div align="left"><p>LAS VEGAS - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today announced the selection of Richard Burgamy as the new director of its Las Vegas local office.  As of Aug. 16, 2015, Burgamy oversees the EEOC's operations in southern
Nevada, specifically in the counties of Clark, Esmeralda, Lincoln, Mineral and Nye. </p>
<p>"Richard Burgamy's extraordinary commitment to civil rights and wealth of expertise, stemming from both his civilian and military service, make him a natural choice to lead the EEOC's Las Vegas Local Office," said Rosa M. Viramontes, district
director for the EEOC's Los Angeles District, which oversees the Las Vegas Local Office.</p>
<p>Although born and raised in Texas, Burgamy maintained a strong connection to Nevada in recent years given that his parents are both long-time residents of that state.  After honorably serving his country in the U.S. Army, Burgamy earned a
bachelor's degree in sociology and a master's degree in psychology from Chapman University.  He proceeded to earn his doctorate in psychology at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology.  Burgamy served as an equal employment
opportunity officer with the U.S. Department of Justice prior to joining the EEOC in 2010 as an enforcement investigator. </p>
<p>Burgamy said, "I am deeply honored to serve Nevadans in our mission to stop and remedy illegal employment discrimination.  In my new leadership capacity, I will work to ensure that Nevadans have equal rights and opportunities in the
workplace regardless of race, color of skin, national origin, sex, religion, age, disability or genetic information." </p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  The EEOC's Las Vegas Local Office is located at 333 Las Vegas Blvd., South, Ste. 8112 in Las Vegas, NV 89101.  For assistance, call the EEOC at
1-800-669-4000 or 1-800-669-6820 TTY.  Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
