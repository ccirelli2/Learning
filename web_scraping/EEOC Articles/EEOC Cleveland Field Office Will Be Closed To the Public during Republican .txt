<h1>EEOC Cleveland Field Office Will Be Closed To the Public during Republican National Convention</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>CLEVELAND - Due to the expected record number of Republican National Committee (RNC) related activities and people in close proximity to the Anthony J. Celebrezze (AJC) Federal Building where the Cleveland Field Office of EEOC is located, as well
as anticipated transportation delays, EEOC staff will not be physically working in the office at 1240 East 9th Street, from July 18, 2016 through July 22, 2016.  EEOC staff will instead work remotely. The office will resume regular business
hours on Monday, July 25, 2016. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Questions and Answers</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Question</strong>:  Will I be able to drop off my paperwork for EEOC at the AJC Building during the week of the RNC?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:  Yes.  The AJC Federal Building will be open.  There will be added security checkpoints and screening upon entering the building.  Members of the public who would like to pick up or drop off EEOC
intake forms may do so, but staff will be unavailable.  Blank forms and envelopes will be available outside of Suite 3001.  Please note that if you want to file a charge of job discrimination, you have 300 days from the date of harm to
file a charge with EEOC in the state of Ohio. Please visit <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>  for more information about filing a charge or obtaining the status of a charge. </p>

<p><strong>2. Question</strong>:  Will I be able to have an intake interview during the week of the RNC convention?</p>

<p><strong>3. Question</strong>:  How much time do I have to file a charge?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:  You have 300 days from the date of harm (i.e. got fired, denied promotion, etc.) to file a charge with EEOC in the state of Ohio.  This filing limit cannot be extended by EEOC.</p>
<p><strong>4.  Question</strong>:  What if my time for filing a charge is about to run out before EEOC reopens on July 25th?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:  We strongly encourage you to contact the Cleveland EEOC office prior to July 12, 2016.  The direct number for the Cleveland office is 216-522-2001.  You may also visit the office at 1240 East 9th Street,
Suite 3001 on or before July 12th.  If you can, please visit <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a> and under "How to File a Charge", look for the <strong>online assessment tool</strong> link and follow the
prompts.  You can obtain an intake questionnaire to complete and return to our office either in person before July 12th or by mail. </p>
<p>The intake questionnaire will ask if you intend for the document to be considered your charge of job discrimination (which means the employer will be notified).  If you answer 'Yes', you may consider the charge informally "filed", and the
clock stops running for time concerns.  However, you will be contacted to complete more formal document when we return to the office after the RNC convention. </p>
<p>However, please note that if you complete an intake questionnaire and on the questionnaire you indicate that you'd like to talk to us before we notify the employer, this is <strong>not</strong> considered a "filed" charge and it does not stop the
clock for filing time concerns.  Please note, you may contact our call center and they will assist you in getting help from another EEOC office, if necessary.  Just dial 1-800-669-4000.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Question</strong>:  What will EEOC staff be doing week of the RNC convention?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:  The Cleveland Field Office staff will either be utilizing telework, training off-site or taking accrued leave during the week of the office closure.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Question</strong>:  Where can I get more information about the RNC activities, transportation and traffic?</p>
