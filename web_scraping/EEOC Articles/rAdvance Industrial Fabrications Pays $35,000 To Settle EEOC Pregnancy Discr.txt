<p>ATLANTA – Advance Industrial Fabrications, Inc., formerly known as Advance Industrial Maintenance &amp; Machine, Inc., will pay $35,000 to settle a pregnancy discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>The EEOC had charged that Advance Industrial Fabrications, a fabrication and machine shop in Augusta, Ga., discriminated against an office worker by firing her due to her pregnancy. The lawsuit stated that front office worker Elizabeth Courtney was terminated within a month of disclosing her pregnancy status to the company’s president. According to the lawsuit, the stated reason for Courtney’s termination was “Medical Condition prevents employee’s attendance, and she is therefore unable to perform duties.”</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The EEOC filed suit in September 2010 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>The consent decree settling the suit, in addition to the monetary relief of $35,000, includes provisions for equal employment opportunity training, reporting, and postings. In the suit and consent decree, Advance Industrial Fabrications denied any liability or wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of Title VII prohibits employers from singling out pregnancy-related conditions in determining an employee’s ability to work,” said Robert Dawkins, Regional Attorney for the Atlanta District Office. “We are pleased that Advance Industrial Fabrications was committed to resolving this matter and taking steps to ensure future compliance with the law.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
