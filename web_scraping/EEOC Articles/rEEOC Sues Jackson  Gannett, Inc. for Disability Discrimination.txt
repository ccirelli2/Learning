<h1>EEOC Sues Jackson / Gannett, Inc. for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Federal Agency Says Tennessee Newspaper Fired Manager Because of Back Injuries, Refusing Reasonable Accommodation</em></strong></p>
<p>MEMPHIS – <em>The Jackson Sun</em>, a Gannett daily newspaper in Jackson, Tenn., and its affiliated companies violated federal law by terminating a disabled manager because of his back injury and neurological impairments, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed on August 15, 2011.</p>
<p>The EEOC’s suit against Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc., doing business as Jackson Sun Media Works, and Gannett Co., Inc. alleges that <em>The Jackson Sun</em> terminated David Dubois when he returned to work after a medical leave of absence and sought a reasonable accommodation. Dubois worked for <em>The Jackson Sun</em> as a print manager and sold and supervised commercial print jobs. In February 2008, Dubois went on medical leave for back surgery due to a herniated disc. During the surgery he sustained permanent spinal cord damage that limited some lower body functions. According to the EEOC’s suit, <em>The Jackson Sun</em> terminated Dubois one week after he returned to work and expressed a need for reasonable accommodation. The company told him that it had eliminated his job.</p>
<p>Discharging an individual because of a disability violates the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 1:11-cv-01252 in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Eastern Division) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The lawsuit asks the court, among other things, to grant a permanent injunction enjoining <em>The Jackson Sun</em> from further discharging employees based on their disabilities. It also seeks lost wages, other out-of-pocket expenses, and compensatory and punitive damages for Dubois.</p>
<p>“The ADA prohibits employers from terminating people with disabilities based on assumptions about how these employees will perform their job duties or because they need a reasonable accommodation,” said Katharine W. Kores, the EEOC’s director for the Memphis District Office. “The EEOC is absolutely committed to its responsibility in enforcing the ADA.” </p>
<p><em>The Jackson Sun</em> also sells the use of its printing press for commercial printing jobs. The Sun’s commercial printing operation uses the name “Sun Printing.” Gannett Co. Inc. purchased <em>The Jackson Sun</em> in 1985. An international media and marketing company, McLean, Va.-based Gannett Co. Inc. owns newspapers, magazines, internet companies and television stations throughout the United States and England.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
