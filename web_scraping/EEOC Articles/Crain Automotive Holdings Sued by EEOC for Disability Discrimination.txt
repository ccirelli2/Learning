<h1>Crain Automotive Holdings Sued by EEOC for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Company Denied an Employee an Accommodation for Her Emotional Disabilities and Fired Her Instead, Federal Agency Charges</strong></em></p>
<p>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. - Crain Automotive Holdings, Inc., located in Sherwood, Ark., violated federal law when it refused to accommodate an employee and fired her because of her disability, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
charged in a lawsuit filed yesterday.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's lawsuit, the employee suffers from anxiety, depression, and panic attacks. She attempted to communicate her medical conditions to her supervisors; however, Crain refused to discuss accommodation options with the employee
and instead terminated her within days of learning of her disabilities, the EEOC said.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Western Division, Civil Action No. 4:17-cv-627-JLH, after first attempting to reach a
pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The suit seeks monetary relief in the form of back pay, compensatory and punitive damages, compensation for lost benefits, and an injunction against future discrimination.</p>
<p>"The ADA protects people with disabilities so that they have an equal opportunity to achieve success in the workplace," said Katharine W. Kores, district director of the EEOC's Memphis District Office, which has jurisdiction over Arkansas,
Tennessee and portions of Mississippi. "People with disabilities face enough obstacles in their everyday lives. The ability to work free of discrimination should not be one of those obstacles. This issue remains a priority for the EEOC."</p>
<p>Crain Automotive, headquartered in Sherwood, Ark., is comprised of 16 automotive dealerships whose primary business is selling and trading new and used vehicles, selling retail and wholesale parts, and repairing vehicles.</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the latest EEOC news by
