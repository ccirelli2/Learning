<h1>EEOC Opens Service Center in Los Angeles for People Seeking Release of Documents Under FOIA, Section 83</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Center is Second in the Country, Joining Original in Washington Headquarters</strong></em></p>
<p>LOS ANGELES - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today it has launched a Requester Service Center at the federal agency's Los Angeles District Office (LADO).</p>
<p>The center will provide customer service to people seeking information from the EEOC under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or Section 83 of the EEOC's Compliance Manual--the special disclosure rules by which aggrieved parties, charging
parties, respondents and their attorneys may access their own charge files after the Commission has completed its proceedings.  The service center will also respond to other persons seeking disclosure of charge files and other records. 
The center will operate a multilingual telephone line 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and staff will respond to telephone calls and e-mail messages during the LADO's regular business hours.  The center can be reached at (877) 403-8609 or <a href="mailto:LOSAFOIA@eeoc.gov" id="mailto:LOSAFOIA@eeoc.gov|">LOSAFOIA@eeoc.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The original EEOC Requester Service Center, which continues to function, opened in 2005 in the EEOC's Office of Legal Counsel at the agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C. to provide customer service to FOIA requesters and other persons
seeking information concerning FOIA.  It can be reached at (202) 663-4500 or <a href="mailto:FOIA@eeoc.gov" id="mailto:FOIA@eeoc.gov|">FOIA@eeoc.gov</a>.  Both centers may also be reached toll-free at<br/>
(877) 869-1802.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Additional information about the EEOC is available on its web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
