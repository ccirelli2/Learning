<h1>Cadillac Jack Sued by EEOC for Retaliation</h1>

<p>ATLANTA – In an employment discrimination lawsuit it recently filed, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged that Cadillac Jack, Inc., a supplier of innovative games and systems to the global gaming industry in Duluth, Ga., violated federal law when it fired a manager in retaliation for complaining about race and gender discrimination.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, the employer terminated Tracey Tucker, an African-American, from her position as a contracts manager on July 15, 2009, in retaliation for complaining about race and gender discrimination.  Tucker, who was hired in October 2006, engaged in activity protected by federal law on July 8, 2009, when she informed her supervisor that she felt she was being subjected to discrimination.  She reiterated her concerns on July 14, 2009, when she met with her supervisor and the human resources director.  The next day, Tucker was terminated.</p>
<p>The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 1:11-cv-02953) in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.   The EEOC is seeking back pay and compensatory and punitive damages for Tucker.  The lawsuit also seeks injunctive relief designed to stop discrimination and prevent it from recurring in the future.</p>
<p>“Terminating an employee after she stands up for her rights represents one of the most blatant forms of unlawful retaliation,” said Bernice Williams-Kimbrough, district director for the EEOC in Atlanta.  “The EEOC will continue to vigorously protect employees’ rights to complain about discrimination.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at www.eeoc.gov. <br/>
