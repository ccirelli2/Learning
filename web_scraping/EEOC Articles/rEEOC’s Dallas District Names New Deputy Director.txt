<h1>EEOC’s Dallas District Names New Deputy Director</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>DALLAS - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has announced the selection of Belinda McCallister as the new deputy director of its Dallas District Office.</p>
<p>"Belinda has a track record of technical excellence, outstanding leadership and communication skills, a work ethic beyond reproach and, most importantly, a commitment to EEOC," said Janet Elizondo, director of the EEOC's Dallas
District.  "Her desire for excellence and efficiency is displayed in all she does."</p>
<p>McCallister has 25 years experience in the area of employment discrimination. She began her career with EEOC as a high school intern and has worked during her tenure as an investigator, enforcement supervisor, and director of the EEOC's El Paso
Area Office prior to her selection as deputy district director.</p>
<p>McCallister said, "My goal is to continue our pursuit of justice in the communities we serve. We cannot just stand by; we must continue to stand up and ensure that every individual is afforded equal opportunities in the workplace."</p>
<p>The EEOC's Dallas District takes and investigates charges of employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability and genetic information, and it covers a geographic area that includes most of Texas
(except southeast Texas) and the southern half of New Mexico.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information about the agency is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
