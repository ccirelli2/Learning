<h1>EEOC Seeks Input on FY 2012-2016 Strategic Plan</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has released for public comment a draft of its Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2012 - 2016. The draft plan can be found at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/strategic_plan_12to16_DRAFT.cfm" id="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/strategic_plan_12to16_DRAFT.cfm|">http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/strategic_plan_12to16_DRAFT.cfm</a>. Comments must be submitted by 5:00 pm ET on February 1, 2012 at <a href="mailto:strategic.plan@eeoc.gov">strategic.plan@eeoc.gov</a> or by mail to Office of the Chair, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 131 M Street, NE, Washington, DC 20507. This draft plan has not been approved by the Commission and is still under review.</p>
<p>The Strategic Plan serves as a framework for the Commission in achieving its mission by focusing on strategic law enforcement, education, and outreach, and efficiently serving the public. The EEOC has served as the nation’s lead enforcer of employment antidiscrimination laws and chief promoter of equal employment opportunity (EEO) since 1965. Every four fiscal years, Congress requires Executive departments, government corporations, and independent agencies to develop and post a strategic plan on their public website. These plans direct the agency’s work and lay the foundation for the development of more detailed annual plans, budgets, and related program performance information in the future. The EEOC is currently operating under the Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2007 - 2012, as modified in July 2008. </p>
<p>The process for developing this plan has been highly inclusive and collaborative. The plan was created by work groups comprised of staff from the EEOC’s headquarters and field offices, with a broad range of internal and external expertise and understanding of the programs and activities conducted within the agency. We are now continuing this inclusive effort by soliciting comments from our public partners, including advocacy groups and individuals. Your input is vital to our efforts to ensure accountability to our nation’s workers, employers, and taxpayers in general.</p>
