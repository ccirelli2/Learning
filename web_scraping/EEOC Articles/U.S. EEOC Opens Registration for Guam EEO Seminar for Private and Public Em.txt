<h1>U.S. EEOC Opens Registration for Guam EEO Seminar for Private and Public Employers</h1>
</div>

<p>GUAM - The federal agency tasked with enforcing laws against employment discrimination, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), announced that it will be hosting a rare EEOC full-day seminar for both private and public employer
representatives on Sept. 19 in Tumon, Guam.</p>
<p>The seminar will feature keynote presentations by EEOC Los Angeles District Director Rosa Viramontes; EEOC Los Angeles District Deputy Director Christine Park-Gonzalez; EEOC Supervisory Administrative Judge Diane Gross; EEOC Supervisory Trial
Attorney Rumduol Vuong; and EEOC Honolulu Local Office Director Glory Gervacio Saure. Officials from the Guam Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal
Contract Compliance Programs are also slated to present.</p>
<p>The seminar is geared toward attorneys, mediators, human resource, union officials and equal employment opportunity (EEO) professionals in the private and federal sectors, along with other interested parties. The comprehensive training sessions
and workshops will provide updates and guidance on EEO law and how to approach EEO cases the way the EEOC experts do, with an emphasis on dealing with harassment in the workplace. There is also a federal sector track for EEO professionals and
attorneys representing federal agencies, along with a selection of workshops to customize the learning experience. The last EEOC seminar held in Guam was in 2014.</p>
<p>"It is with great pleasure that we return to Guam to connect with local employer representatives," said Rosa Viramontes, district director for the EEOC's Los Angeles District, which includes Guam in its jurisdiction. "With so much change in the
wind, our seminar is an opportunity to hear firsthand from EEOC officials who will provide updates and guidance on how to address and prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation in the workplace."</p>
