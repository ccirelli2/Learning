<h1>U.S. Foodservice, Inc. Sued by EEOC for Race Discrimination</h1>

<div align="left"><p align="center"><em><strong>Food Service Distribution Company Fired Employee Due to Race, Federal Agency Charges</strong></em></p>
<p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. – A Rosemont, Ill.-based company that distributes food products, cleaning supplies and food service equipment violated federal law by discriminating against an employee because of his race (black), the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today.</p>
<p>The EEOC’s suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Western Division asserts that U.S. Foodservice, Inc. violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it subjected Aswad Clark, who worked for U.S. Foodservice at its facility in Memphis, to unequal terms and conditions of employment, and then fired him, because of his race. <br/>
</p>
<p>The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.  The agency’s lawsuit seeks monetary relief in the form of back pay, compensatory and punitive damages, reinstatement and an injunction against future discrimination, among other items.<br/>
</p>
<p>“It is a serious violation of Title VII to discharge an employee based on race,” said Katharine W. Kores, district director of the EEOC’s Memphis District Office, which has jurisdiction over Arkansas, Tennessee and portions of Mississippi.  “The agency is committed to combating this type of blatant discrimination.” <br/>
</p>
<p>U.S. Foodservice, Inc. employs around 25,000 associates in more than 60 locations. <br/>
</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
