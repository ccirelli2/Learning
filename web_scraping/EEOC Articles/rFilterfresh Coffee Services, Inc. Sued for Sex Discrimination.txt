<h1>Filterfresh Coffee Services, Inc. Sued for Sex Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><em><strong>Company Fired Female Employee, Provided Male Counterpart With More Opportunities</strong></em></p>
<p>ATLANTA – Filterfresh Coffee Services, Inc., violated federal law when it discharged a female employee because of her sex, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed yesterday. <br/>
</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, Civil Action No. 1:11-cv-3331-HTW-GGB, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, Filterfresh fired Business Development Representative, Kelli Easterling, after she purportedly failed to reach the company’s profit goals.  However, a male counterpart, who was also having difficulty reaching the company’s profit goals, was afforded greater opportunities by management to ensure his success.  <br/>
</p>
<p>The alleged conduct of Filterfresh Coffee Services, Inc. violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement.  The EEOC is seeking back pay and compensatory and punitive damages for Easterling.  The lawsuit also seeks injunctive relief designed to stop the discrimination and prevent it from recurring in the future. <br/>
</p>
<p>“Employees must be provided the same opportunities to succeed and be evaluated on a level playing field regardless of gender,” said Bernice Williams Kimbrough, district director for the EEOC’s Atlanta District Office.  “A company is required by law to provide equal terms and conditions of employment and not hold employees to different standards based on their gender.  It is the EEOC’s mission to make sure that all employees receive equal and fair treatment.”</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination.  Further information is available at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
