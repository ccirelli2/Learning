<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Agency’s Denver Field Office Invites Teenagers to Participate in Forum</em></strong></p>
<p>DENVER -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is asking teenagers to weigh in on the heavy issues of equal pay and wage disparity.</p>
<p>On April 26, 2012, the EEOC will recognize the 20th anniversary of Take Your Child to Work Day by inviting teenagers to its Denver Field Office to participate in a dialogue for solutions on how to bridge the gender wage gap in America. </p>
<p>Suggestions from this forum will be sent to the National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force in Washington, D.C.  EEOC Chair Jacqueline Berrien is a member of that body, which is headed by Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>“The EEOC believes that teenagers between the ages of 14 and 18 represent an unbiased group that may have the ability to solve a problem that has plagued generations,” said Denver EEOC Field Director Nancy Sienko.  “We want to hear what they have to say.”</p>
<p>The forum will take place from 1:00 pm to 3:30 pm at the EEOC’s Denver Field Office, 303 East 17th Avenue, Suite 410, Denver.  Participants will be asked to sign their names to a registration sheet, which will be kept for historical purposes.</p>
<p>All participants must register in advance at: <a href="http://bringyourteentoworkateeoc.eventbrite.com/?ref=enivtefor&amp;invite=MTgwMzE2OS9wYXRyaWNpYS5tY21haG9uQGVlb2MuZ292LzA%3D&amp;utm_source=eb_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=inviteformal&amp;utm_term=attend" id="http://bringyourteentoworkateeoc.eventbrite.com/?ref=enivtefor&amp;invite=MTgwMzE2OS9wYXRyaWNpYS5tY21haG9uQGVlb2MuZ292LzA%3D&amp;utm_source=eb_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=inviteformal&amp;utm_term=attend|">http://bringyourteentoworkateeoc.eventbrite.com/?ref=enivtefor&amp;invite=MTgwMzE2OS9wYXRyaWNpYS5tY21haG9uQGVlb2MuZ292LzA%3D&amp;utm_source=eb_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=inviteformal&amp;utm_term=attend</a></p>
