<h1>EEOC Sues Miracle Hill Golf and Tennis Center for Sexual Harassment</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><em><strong>Miracle Hill Superintendent Harassed Women Workers by Calling Them Names, Demanding Kisses, and Exposing Himself</strong></em></p>
<p>KANSAS CITY – Miracle Hill Golf and Tennis Center violated federal law when it allowed the golf superintendent to repeatedly sexually harass women servers, bartenders and other female employees at its restaurant and golf course in Omaha, Neb., the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed today in federal court. <br/>
</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, the Superintendent at Miracle Hills asked the women to kiss him, called them names such as “lard ass” and “bubble butt,” pulled their clothes off them to expose their breasts or buttocks, and made unwelcome sexual advances toward them.  The harassment was so intolerable that the women were forced to quit their jobs.</p>
<p>“The harassment was longstanding and egregious,” said Barbara A. Seely, regional attorney of the EEOC’s St. Louis District Office.  “The women made repeated complaints to the superintendent and other staff, but the superintendent would continue to make sexual remarks, touch them and also encourage customers to join in.”<br/>
</p>
<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, protects workers from discrimination based upon gender, including sexual harassment.  The EEOC filed this suit, Case No. 8:11-cv-00336 in U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska, after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement. <br/>
</p>
<p>The EEOC St. Louis District Office is responsible for processing charges of discrimination, administrative enforcement, and the conduct of agency litigation in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and southern Illinois, with Area Offices in Kansas City and Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>Miracle Hill Golf and Tennis Center is open to the public and located in heart of Omaha.  According to its website, it is owned by GMT, LLC.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
