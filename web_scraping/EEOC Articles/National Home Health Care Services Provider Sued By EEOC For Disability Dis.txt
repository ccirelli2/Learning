<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Hamilton, Ohio-based home health care services provider Personal Touch Home Care, with 50 locations in 13 states, violated federal law by firing an employee because of her physical disabilities, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today. </p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, Personal Touch Home Care fired Pamula Calfee because of her disabilities: renal failure, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and asthma.  Calfee had worked for Personal Touch Home Care since 2000 and had no problems performing her job even with her disabilities, the EEOC said.  </p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA).  The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No.1:11-c v-00042-SJD) in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Cincinnati Division after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement.  In its suit, the EEOC seeks back pay and compensatory and punitive damages for Calfee, as well as injunctive relief.</p>
<p>“Treating an employee badly based on a physical impairment violates the very core of the ADA,” said EEOC Indianapolis District Office Regional Attorney Laurie Young.  “The EEOC will continue to fight for the rights of disability discrimination victims.”  </p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency’s web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
