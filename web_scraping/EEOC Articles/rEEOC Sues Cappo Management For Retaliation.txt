<h1>EEOC Sues Cappo Management For Retaliation</h1>

<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Cappo Management XX, Inc., the owners of a  Dickson, Tenn.,  automobile dealership, violated federal law by firing three employees for  protesting sexual harassment, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed on March 5, 2012.</p>
<p>The EEOC’s suit Civil Action No. 3:12-cv-00239, filed in  U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville Division,  alleged that Cappo fired Korie Dunn, Traci Manor and Carolyn Love, salespersons  at Victory Nissan of Dickson, because they complained about sexual harassment  by their sales manager. After they  complained as a group, Cappo placed them on a paid leave of absence for a  week. When they returned, Cappo said  that it had fired the sales manager after he failed to show up for an interview  about their complaints. Cappo then fired  them the same day for allegedly poor sales.</p>
<p>Retaliation  for complaining about sexual harassment violates Title VII of the Civil Rights  Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit after  first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation  process.</p>
<p>“Federal law provides that employees have a right to  complain about practices they believe are unlawful without repercussions,” said  Katharine W. Kores, director of the EEOC’s Memphis District Office.</p>
<p>The  EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is  available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov.</a></p></div>
