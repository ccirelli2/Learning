<h1>Kaufman Children’s Center Sued by EEOC for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Disabled Employee Barred from Returning to Work after Medical Leave, Federal Agency Charges</strong></em></p>
<p>DETROIT - Kaufman Children's Center violated federal law when it terminated an employee with a disability returning to work from a medical leave absence, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged in a lawsuit filed today.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Kaufman Children's Center refused to let the employee, an Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) Therapist, return to work in a light duty capacity or offer the employee another reasonable accommodation after she was off work
due to a serious cardiac condition. When she sought to return to her previous position, Kaufman Children's Center formally fired her because of her disability, the EEOC said. </p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit (<em>EEOC v. Kaufman Children's Center for Speech, Language, Sensory-motor, &amp; Social connections, Inc</em>., Case No. 2:14-cv-14947) in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan after first seeking to reach a voluntary settlement through its pre-litigation conciliation process. The Commission seeks to recover monetary compensation for the fired employee, including back pay
and compensatory damages for emotional distress, as well as punitive damages.</p>
<p>"Employers violate the ADA when they ignore requests for a reasonable accommodation and terminate employees because they are disabled," explained Nedra Campbell, trial attorney for the EEOC. "Kaufman Children's Center had a duty to determine if
it could accommodate this employee," she added. </p>
<p>Kaufman Children's Center for Speech, Language, Sensory-motor, &amp; Social Connections, Inc. is a Michigan company that specializes in providing services to autistic children (<a href="http://www.kidspeech.com" id="http://www.kidspeech.com|">www.kidspeech.com</a>). </p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information is available at www.eeoc.gov. <br/>
