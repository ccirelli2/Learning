<h1>EEOC Sues MBM Corporation of Mason City for Race Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Giant  Food Distributor Failed to Remove Racist Imagery Even After Complaints, Federal  Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>MASON  CITY, Iowa - The MBM Corporation's food  distribution facility in Mason City, Iowa, one of many operated by the company,  violated the law when company officials failed to remove racist graffiti from  the men's room
even after receiving a complaint, the U.S. Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed in federal court on  Sept. 25. (<em>EEOC v. MBM Corporation,</em> N.  District Iowa No. 3:12-cv-03069-MWB, D.
Judge Bennet.)</p>
<p>According to the allegations  of EEOC's lawsuit, racist graffiti appeared in the men's room at the Mason City  facility in mid-May 2011.  The EEOC  alleges that an employee complained to his supervisor about the graffiti
and  yet it remained visible for at least three months, even though MBM Corp.  supervisors frequented the restroom.</p>
<p>Such alleged  conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The EEOC attempted to reach  a voluntary settlement through its statutory conciliation process before filing  suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Iowa, Civil Action No.  12-cv-3069. The EEOC is seeking injunctive relief to prevent future  discrimination, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment  discrimination.  The EEOC's Chicago  District Office is responsible for processing discrimination charges, adminis­trative  enforce­ment, and the
conduct of agency litigation in Illinois, Wisconsin,  Minnesota, Iowa and North and South Dakota, with Area Offices in Milwaukee and  Minneapolis.  Further information about  the EEOC is available on its website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
