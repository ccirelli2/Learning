<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON-Beverly L. Barnes, a seasoned communications professional, was named director of the Office of Communications and Legislative Affairs of the U.S. Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Chair Jenny R. Yang announced today.</p>
<p>"I am delighted to welcome Beverly to the EEOC," said Yang. "Her varied communications experience and expertise in framing issues for many different audiences will be of great help to us as the Commission moves forward with its mission to stop
and remedy employment discrimination."</p>
<p>Barnes comes to the EEOC from her own consulting firm where she worked since 2012 on long-term assignments for national nonprofits looking to boost their internal and external communications. Prior to that, she was the vice president of
Communications and Marketing for the Council on Foundations, and she founded and led Homes for Working Families, a national nonprofit focused on home affordability. Her previous government experience includes working as White House deputy press
secretary and as chief of staff in the Office of Public Affairs at the U.S. Department of Labor. She began her career as a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and spent many years working in communications and media relations at IBM.</p>
<p>"The work of the EEOC is of overriding importance to individuals and to the nation's workplaces," said Barnes. "I am honored to have been selected to work on the vital issue of employment discrimination and look forward to serving with Chair
Yang, the EEOC's Commissioners and my colleagues across the agency to make sure the EEOC's messages reach our audiences-the public, Congress, the Administration, and the media-in the most effective and timely manner."</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces the nation's laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
