<p>"Illegal discrimination is still a major issue in people's lives today," said Holly Hadfield Aguilar, director of the EEOC Savannah Local Office.  "Serving as the local director in Savannah allows me to help people in South Georgia and South
Carolina by making sure their claims are heard and their charges investigated.  I am excited to be a part of the Savannah community as well as the EEOC Atlanta District Office.  I look forward to getting to know the people and businesses
of the jurisdiction we serve."</p>

has been a long-held goal, and I am pleased to have Jim as part of the legal team."  </p>
