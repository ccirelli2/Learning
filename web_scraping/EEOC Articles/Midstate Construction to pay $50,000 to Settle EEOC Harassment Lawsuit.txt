<p>SAN FRANCISCO – A Petaluma, Calif., construction company will pay $50,000 and furnish other relief to settle a national origin discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>The EEOC had charged that Midstate Construction Corp., subjected four Latino workers to verbal harassment by a former supervisor because of their national origin.</p>
<p>Discrimination based on national origin violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement. Midstate denied the allegations but agreed to the settlement of the claim.</p>
<p>“Under this consent decree, Midstate will take steps to ensure that all workers are protected,” said EEOC Regional Attorney William R. Tamayo.</p>
<p>EEOC San Francisco District Director Michael Baldonado added, “All employers should be vigilant that they are in compliance with our federal laws that protect all employees, regardless of where they come from.”</p>
<p>In addition to the monetary award, the consent decree settling the suit provides that Midstate will continue to strengthen its training of all supervisors and employees on national origin harassment; distribute its anti-harassment policy and procedures in English and Spanish to employees; and maintain other record-keeping requirements.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. The San Francisco District's jurisdiction includes Northern California, Northern Nevada, Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington.
