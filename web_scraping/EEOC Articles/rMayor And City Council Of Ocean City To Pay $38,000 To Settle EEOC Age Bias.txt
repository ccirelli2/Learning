<p>BALTIMORE –The mayor and city  council of Ocean City, Md., will pay $38,000 and furnish other  relief to settle an age discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by the  U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced  today.</p>
<p>According  to EEOC’s suit (JFM/PWG-10-02690), filed in U.S District Court for the District  of Maryland, Northern Division, Anthony Indge was not hired into the full-time  position of airport associate because of his age, 62 at the time of his  application, and was not rehired into the position of temporary line technician  in retaliation for his complaints about age discrimination. Indge had been employed as a temporary line  technician and had filled in as an airport associate in 2007 and 2008. While interviewing Indge, the airport manager  at the time (the hiring official) made ageist comments to Indge, despite  previously having informed Indge that his performance made him a valued  employee.</p>
<p>The Age  Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) protects people 40 years of age or older from employment discrimination  based on age. The ADEA’s protections  apply to both employees and job applicants. It is also unlawful to retaliate against an  individual for opposing employment practices that discriminate. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to  reach a voluntary settlement.</p>
<p>The three-year consent decree  settling the suit enjoins the mayor and city council of Ocean City from any  further discriminating against applicants and employees on the basis of age or retaliating against employees who oppose age  discrimination. In addition, all current  and future managers and current employees will receive training on federal laws  prohibiting employment discrimination with an emphasis on age discrimination,  harassment, and retaliation. The initial training will be conducted by the  EEOC. Ocean City  also must post a notice affirming its commitment to maintaining an environment  free from employment discrimination.</p>
<p>“It is important that all employees  know that age discrimination is illegal in all facets of their employment,”  said EEOC Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence.  “Employers have a responsibility to provide all employees and applicants  with fair and decent treatment, regardless of age.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws  prohibiting employment discrimination. Further  information about the Commission is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
