<h1>EEOC to Hold Executive Leadership Training Conference Aug. 21-23 in Gettysburg</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will hold its Executive Leadership Training Conference (ELTC) on Aug. 21-23 at the Wyndham Hotel in Gettysburg, Pa., the federal agency announced today. This year's theme,
"Leadership Boot Camp: Training to Win," is designed to give participants skills to build successful teams that produce game-changing results within their organizations. Successful leaders create teams that have high engagement, more trust, and
stronger relationships with team members and other stakeholders. To learn more about the ELTC or for registration and exhibitor information, visit us at <a href="http://eeocleadershipconference.com/default.asp">http://eeocleadershipconference.com/default.asp</a></p>
<p>The ELTC meets the professional development needs of senior leaders in the field of equal employment opportunity (EEO), human resources (HR) and diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I). Training will address key leadership competencies; personal
development and critically important topics vital to the success of current and future executives - particularly senior EEO officials for federal, state and local governments; private sector EEO executives; HR executives with responsibility for
managing and implementing an EEO program; and those striving to attain senior-level positions.</p>
<p>"The ELTC is a cost-effective and modest investment in the executive leadership skills necessary to run a successful EEO program," said Carlton M. Hadden, director of the EEOC's Office of Federal Operations. "This training will directly address
core leadership competencies, ensuring that EEO professionals have the executive training necessary to meet the challenges of our profession."</p>
<p>The ELTC offers many learning opportunities throughout the three days. Day One begins with a senior executive panel which will address leadership challenges facing today's managers, followed by a networking opportunity to engage in more
interpersonal dialogue. Day Two includes remarks from leadership expert and former Navy Seal Chris Fussell, who is the author of "One Mission: How Leaders Build a Team of Teams," followed by "In the Footsteps of Leaders," which is an experiential
training that is hosted by Gettysburg Foundation and gives participants an opportunity to hone their leadership skills. Day Three leadership trainings include Jack Bray of TrueNorth Wellness, discussing leadership and overall wellness; Paul Meshanko
of Legacy Business Cultures, discussing agile leadership principles;</p>
<p>Crystal Chisholm of Crayne Career Solutions, LLC, demonstrating how to use social media for leadership success; and Vanessa Phipps of Future Force Group, LLC, providing effective communicating strategies for leaders.</p>
<p>Registration is limited to the GS-14 level and above, as well as private sector equivalents.</p>
