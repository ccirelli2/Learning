<h1>EEOC Sues SFI of Tennessee for Race Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Steel Fabricator Fired Three Black Supply Chain Employees Because of Their Race, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. - SFI of Tennessee, LLC, a fabricator and supplier of heavy gauge steel and value-added products, violated federal law when it fired three supply chain employees because of their race, African American, the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, SFI of Tennessee discharged Jarvis Nathan, D'Laurence Neely, and Shaunita Callicutt on the same day. Nathan, Neely, and Callicutt were employed in SFI's supply chain department, and none had any performance issues
prior to being discharged. The EEOC said that SFI replaced Nathan, Neely, and Callicutt with white employees, and that these actions were motivated by race.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects employees against discrimination based on race. The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 2:14-cv-02740 in U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Tennessee, Western Division) after first attempting to reach a settlement through its pre-litigation conciliation process. The EEOC's suit seeks monetary relief in the form of back pay, lost benefits, and compensatory damages, as well as an
injunction against future discrimination.</p>
<p>"Discharging a group of employees based on race is a serious violation of federal law," said Katharine W. Kores, district director of the EEOC's Memphis District Office, which has jurisdiction over Arkansas, Tennessee and portions of Mississippi.
"The EEOC will continue to protect people from such discriminatory acts."</p>
<p>SFI of Tennessee is a Tennessee corporation with warehouse and production facilities in Memphis. Its principal office is located in South Bend, Ind. SFI of Tennessee has approximately 450 employees.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
