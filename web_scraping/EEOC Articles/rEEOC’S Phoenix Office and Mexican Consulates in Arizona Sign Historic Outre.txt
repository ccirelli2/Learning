</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Pact Establishes Ongoing Collaborative Relationship</em></strong></p>
<p>PHOENIX - The Phoenix District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with several consulates of Mexico in Arizona today. The agreement establishes an ongoing collaborative
relationship between these entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace, regardless of documentation status. Mexican consuls for Phoenix, Nogales,
Tucson, Yuma, and Douglas, Ariz., signed the agreement with Rayford O. Irvin, director of the EEOC's Phoenix District Office.</p>
<p>The Mexican consulates in Arizona provide services to preserve the rights of Mexican nationals residing in Arizona. The EEOC's Phoenix District Office enforces federal employment discrimination laws and has jurisdiction over Arizona, Colorado,
Utah, Wyoming and parts of New Mexico.</p>
<p>"This pact will promote employment justice and allow us to enhance and carry forward our mission to protect people's basic human rights," said Irvin.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the EEOC will expand its cooperation with the Mexican consulates, providing them with Spanish-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the EEOC. The agency will also provide
representatives to meet with Mexican nationals in Arizona in order to disseminate information and conduct counseling regarding employment discrimination matters.</p>
<p>The EEOC and the Mexican Consulate will also work together to regularly provide information regarding workplace discrimination on Spanish-language radio stations throughout their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment. Further information about the agency is available by calling 1-800-669-4000 and on its website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
