</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Applicant Denied Position Due to Hearing Impairment, Says Federal Agency</em></strong></p>
<p>HONOLULU, Hawaii - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has announced the filing of a lawsuit against Cutter Mazda of Honolulu alleging discrimination against a job applicant due to his disability. EEOC contends that Cutter
Mazda denied an applicant a job based on his hearing impairment.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii <em>(EEOC v. MJC, Inc. and GAC Auto Group, Inc. DBA Cutter Mazda of Honolulu, et al</em>, Case No.
1:17-cv-00371) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement. The agency seeks back-pay, compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of the applicant, along with injunctive relief to prevent and address disability discrimination from
happening in the future.</p>
<p>"Disability discrimination remains a persistent problem that needs more attention by employers," said Anna Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles District, which includes Hawaii in its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Glory Gervacio Saure, director of the EEOC's Honolulu Local Office said, "Applicants should not be denied a position under the assumption that the individual cannot do the essential functions of the job."</p>
<p>MJC, Inc. and GAC Auto Group, Inc. DBA Cutter Mazda of Honolulu operates four automobile dealerships on the island of Oahu. According to their website, <a href="http://www.cuttermazdahonolulu.com" id="http://www.cuttermazdahonolulu.com|">www.cuttermazdahonolulu.com</a>, Cutter Mazda sells new and certified pre-owned vehicles, provides vehicle finance services, along with automobile repair parts and services.</p>
<p>Eliminating barriers in hiring, especially hiring practices that discriminate against people with disabilities, is one of six national priorities identified by the Commission's Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP).</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the
