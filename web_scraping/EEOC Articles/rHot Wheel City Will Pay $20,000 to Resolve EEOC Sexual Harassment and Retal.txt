<h1>Hot Wheel City Will Pay $20,000 to Resolve EEOC Sexual Harassment and Retaliation Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>DETROIT -- Hot Wheel City, a Detroit-based automotive wheel and accessory store chain, has agreed to pay $20,000 and to provide equitable relief to settle a federal sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, Hot Wheel City subjected a female employee to a sexually hostile work environment at the hands of a male co-worker. The EEOC also charged that the employee reported the sexual harassment and was thereafter fired in
retaliation for complaining.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. After first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process, the EEOC sued Hot Wheel City (EEOC v. Hot Wheel City, Inc., Case No.
2:14-cv-11287) in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.</p>
<p>In addition to providing monetary relief to the employee, the seven-year consent decree settling the case requires Hot Wheel City to institute new anti-discrimination policies and procedures; conduct training twice a year on sexual harassment and
retaliation; provide reports to the EEOC regarding its training; and permit the EEOC to monitor its compliance with the terms of the consent decree.</p>
<p>"Hot Wheel City has committed to making significant changes that should be beneficial to current and future employees as well as the company," said EEOC attorney Nedra Campbell. "The company should be commended for resolving this case at this
juncture-well before trial."</p>
<p>Hot Wheel City provides wheels, rims and accessories through its six retail locations located in the Detroit metro area and in Toledo, Ohio. The company has been in business since 1995.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
