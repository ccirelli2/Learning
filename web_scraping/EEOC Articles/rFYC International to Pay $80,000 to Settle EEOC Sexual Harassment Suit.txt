<h1>FYC International to Pay $80,000 to Settle EEOC Sexual Harassment Suit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Top Warehouse Manager Abused Women and Promoted a Culture Condoning Such Misconduct, Federal Agency Charged</strong></em></p>
<p>NEW HAVEN, Conn. - FYC International Inc., a manufacturer and wholesaler of women's and children's clothing and accessories that is no longer in operation, will pay $80,000 and provide other relief to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit by the
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today. </p>
<p>According to EEOC's lawsuit, the FYC warehouse manager regularly subjected female workers to inappropriate sexual comments, gestures, propositions and physical touching. He also offered several female workers money in exchange for sex. EEOC
charged that the manager's sexual harassment was so well known in the warehouse that male workers followed his lead and harassed female employees through inappropriate sexual comments and gestures. </p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. EEOC filed its lawsuit in U.S. District Court District of Connecticut (Case No. 3:14-CV-01414) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its
conciliation process. </p>
<p>The consent decree settling the suit, signed by Judge Vanessa L. Bryant on March 8, 2016, provides that FYC will pay $80,000, to be divided among the three charging parties and their counsel. Also, while FYC has now ceased operations, the decree
provides for extensive safeguards to prevent future discrimination if the company re-emerges, such as hiring an independent compliance official to oversee the implementation of anti-discrimination policies and to investigate complaints.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to have had the opportunity to partner with New Haven Legal Assistance to bring appropriate relief to the charging parties for the harassment they suffered at the hands of the warehouse manager," EEOC Trial Attorney Jadhira Rivera
said. </p>
<p>EEOC New York District Director Kevin Berry added, "We appreciate FYC's willingness to provide appropriate relief to the charging parties and to institute appropriate mechanisms to ensure that discrimination does not persist in the workplace
should the company re-emerge."</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the agency is available at its website at www.eeoc.gov. EEOC's New York District Office oversees New York, Connecticut, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and parts of New Jersey. <br/>
