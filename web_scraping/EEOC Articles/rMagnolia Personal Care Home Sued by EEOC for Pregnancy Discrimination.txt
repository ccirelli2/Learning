<h1>Magnolia Personal Care Home Sued by EEOC for Pregnancy Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Assisted  Living Facility Fired Employee Due to Pregnancy, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>OXFORD,  Miss. - Magnolia NA, LLC, dba Magnolia  Personal Care Home, an assisted living facility located in New Albany, Miss.,  violated federal law when it hired an employee and then discharged her a few  hours later because
of her pregnancy, the U.S. Equal Employment Oppor­tunity  Commission (EEOC) alleged in a lawsuit filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit,  Magnolia hired an employee to work as a kitchen assistant. On her first day of work, she informed her  supervisor of her pregnancy. Three hours  later, the administrator terminated the employee and
later replaced her with a  non-pregnant employee, the EEOC said.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy  Discrimination Act. The EEOC filed suit  (<em>EEOC v. Magnolia NA, LLC d/b/a Magnolia  Personal Care Home</em>, Civil
Action No. 3:14-cv-00210) in U.S. District Court  for the Northern District of Mississippi, Oxford Division, after first attempting to reach a voluntary pre-litigation settlement through  its conciliation process. The EEOC seeks 
injunctive relief to prohibit Magnolia from failing to hire and discharging  employees because of pregnancy in the future.  In addition, the EEOC seeks equitable relief in the form of  reinstatement and back pay as well as and
compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p> "The law is clear -- employers cannot refuse  to hire or discharge women because of their pregnancy," said Katharine W.  Kores, district director of the EEOC's Memphis District Office, which has jurisdiction over  Arkansas,
Tennessee and portions of Mississippi. "It is unfortunate that this kind of unlawful  behavior is even an issue in 2014.  Combating pregnancy discrimin­ation remains a priority for this office  and we will continue to work to
eliminate it until it is no longer an issue."</p>
<p>Magnolia NA, LLC is a  Mississippi company with its principal office in Lyon, Miss.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws  against employment discrimination.  Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov.</a> </p></div>
