<h1>EEOC Sues Midwest Freight Systems for Breach of Mediation Agreement</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p><strong><em>Company Refused to Honor Agreement to Pay Monetary Relief to Charging Party, </em></strong><strong style="font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 1.6em;"><em>Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>DETROIT - Midwest Freight Systems Corporation, a freight transportation company with headquarters in Warren, Mich., violated federal law by failing to comply with its obligations under a mediation settlement agreement which resolved two
employment discrimination charges, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed on August 25, 2016.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's lawsuit, on May 10, Midwest Freight Systems entered into a mediation settlement agreement with EEOC and the discrimination victim, Max Doggett. The mediation agree­ment resolved two charges against the company - the first of
which alleged race and age discrimin­ation, followed by a retaliation charge filed after Doggett was terminated. Under the agreement, Midwest Freight Systems promised to pay Doggett $7,500 in monetary relief. However, the day after signing the
agreement, Midwest Freight Systems informed EEOC that it would not honor the agree­ment or pay any compensation to Doggett. EEOC contends that the company's actions constitute breach of the settlement agreement. </p>
<p>EEOC's suit (<em>EEOC v. Midwest Freight Systems Corp</em>., Civil Action No. 2:16-CV-13079, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan) seeks enforcement of all terms of the medi­ation agreement, including the obligation
to pay $7,500 to Doggett.</p>
<p>"An employer's refusal to honor a voluntary mediation agreement is a rare occurrence," said EEOC Senior Trial Attorney Omar Weaver. "After reasonable efforts to obtain voluntary compliance, EEOC had no choice but to seek court intervention to
enforce the agreement."</p>
<p>The Detroit Field Office is part of the Indianapolis District Office, which oversees Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky and parts of Ohio.</p>
<p>EEOC is the federal agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on the agency's website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a></p></div>
