<h1>Apartment Complex Sued by EEOC for National Origin and Pregnancy Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Federal Agency Charges Ryan's Pointe, LLC Fired Manager Because of </em></strong><strong><em>Her Hispanic National Origin and Pregnancy</em></strong></p>
<p>HOUSTON - Ryan's Pointe, LLC violated federal law by discharging its apartment manager because of her Hispanic national origin and pregnancy, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed today.  Ryan's
Pointe, LLC does business as Advantage Property Management.</p>
<p>EEOC's suit alleges the defendants terminated Magali Villalobos, property manager in the company's Katy-area apartment complex, because of her national origin (Mexican) and her pregnancy.  The suit charges that after the company purchased
the apartment complex, it sought to change the racial demographics of the apartment's tenants and staff, resulting in Villalobos' firing on or about March 21, 2012.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, which prohibits discrimination because of national origin and sex or pregnancy.   EEOC filed suit (<em>Civil Action No.</em> 4:15-cv-02782) in U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Texas after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.  EEOC is seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting the company from engaging in future employment
discrimination, as well as back pay, compensa­tory and punitive damages, compensation for lost benefits and injunctive equitable relief.</p>
<p>"Employers cannot discriminate on the basis of an employee's national origin or gender," said Keith Hill, acting district director for EEOC's Houston District Office.  "To do so is a violation of federal law.<em>"</em></p>
<p>Jim Sacher, EEOC regional attorney for the Houston District Office said, "Employers who violate Title VII should expect to be held accountable."</p>
<p>The Houston District Office of EEOC oversees Southeast Texas, which includes Houston, as well as the New Orleans Field Office, which covers the State of Louisiana.</p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov./">www.eeoc.gov.</a></p></div>
