<h1>Americold Logistics Sued by EEOC for Disability Discrimination</h1>

<p>INDIANAPOLIS -- The U.S.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today it has filed a disability  discrimination lawsuit against Americold Logistics, LLC, an Atlanta-based  global provider of temperature-controlled warehousing and logistics to the food  industry.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit (Civil  Action No. 4:12-cv-47-M) filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District  of Kentucky, Owensboro Division), Americold failed to accommodate the  disability of Patricia Berry, an employee at Americold’s Sebree, Ky.,  facility. Berry has chronic lumbar back pain with  radiculopathy into her legs. Further,  the EEOC said, Americold held Berry  to different terms and conditions of employment and then fired her based on her  disability.</p>
<p>Disability discrimination violates  the Americans with Disability Act (ADA).  The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation  settlement through its conciliation process.  In its suit, the EEOC seeks back pay as well as compensatory and  punitive damages for Berry  and injunctive relief.</p>
<p>“The  disparate treatment of an employee based his or her disability violates the  very core of the ADA,”  said EEOC Indianapolis District Office Regional Attorney Laurie Young.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws  prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is  available on the agency’s web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
