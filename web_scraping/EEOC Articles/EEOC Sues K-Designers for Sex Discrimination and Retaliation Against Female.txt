<h1>EEOC Sues K-Designers for Sex Discrimination and Retaliation Against Female Sales Manager</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Remodeling Company Fired Woman for Complaining About Sexual Harassment, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>ST. LOUIS – Judson Enterprises, Inc., doing business as K-Designers, of Rancho Cordova, Calif., violated federal law by subjecting a former female sales manager in its Omaha, Neb., branch to sex discrimination and retaliating against her for complaining about sexual harassment, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed yesterday.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit (Case No. 8:10-cv-5), filed in U.S. District Court in Omaha, the EEOC claims that from June 2006 until June 2007, K-Designers’ management subjected sales manager Corri Buckley to unlawful sex discrimination and retaliation for complaining about sexual harassment by her branch manager The discrimination included denying Buckley training and staff, attempting to isolate her from other employees, placing her on disability leave when she was able to work, and ultimately terminating her.</p>
<p>K-Designers is an exterior home remodeling company with 11 branches located in upper Mid-west and Western states. It employs approximately 900 people.</p>
<p>“Ms. Buckley worked in a male-dominated environment,” said EEOC St. Louis District Director James R. Neely, Jr. “She had a right to be free from sex discrimination and to complain about unlawful sexual harassment without retribution.”</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex (including sexual harassment or pregnancy) or national origin, and protects employees who complain about such offenses from retaliation. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency’s web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
