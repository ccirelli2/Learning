<h1>Chemcore to Pay $30,000 to Settle EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination Suit</h1>

<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Wholesale  Supplier Fired Employee Hours After She Reported Pregnancy, Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>ATLANTA - Chemcore  Industries, Inc. and Chemcore Industries of Georgia, LLC, a wholesale supplier of  sinks, faucets and related accessories to fabricators, plumbing suppliers and  contractors, will pay $30,000 to settle a
pregnancy discrimination lawsuit  brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency  announced today.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, filed on Sept. 29, 2011 in U.S. District  Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division (Civil Action No.,  1:11-CV-03323), the EEOC charged that Chemcore fired Marie Simmons, a customer service
representative, within  several hours after she disclosed her pregnancy to her supervisor.  Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimin­ation Act  (PDA), which
prohibits employers from subjecting employees to discrimination due  to pregnancy.  The EEOC filed suit after  first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation  process.</p>
<p>In addition to the monetary relief, the consent decree  settling the suit includes provisions for equal employment opportunity training,  reporting of internal discrimination complaints, and posting of  anti-discrimination
notices.  In the  lawsuit and consent decree, Chemcore denied any liability or wrongdoing.</p>
<p>"Ms. Simmons, like other working  females, had a right to start a family without fear of losing her job," said  Robert Dawkins, regional attorney for the EEOC's Atlanta District Office.  "The EEOC is committed to protecting
the  rights of pregnant employees under federal law."</p>
<p>  The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is  available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov.</a></p></div>
