<h1>EEOC's Philadelphia District Office and Mexican Consulate Sign Historic Outreach Agreement</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Agreement Establishes Ongoing Collaborative Relationship Between the Two Entities</strong></em></p>
<p>PHILADELPIA- The Philadelphia District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Consulate of Mexico in Philadelphia today.  The agreement establishes an ongoing
collaborative relationship between these two entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace, regardless of documentation status.  Mexican Consul
Carlos I. Giralt Cabrales and Spencer H. Lewis, Jr., director of the EEOC's Philadelphia District Office, signed the agreement.</p>
<p>The Mexican Consulate in Philadelphia provides services to preserve the rights of Mexican nationals residing in Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern New Jersey.  The EEOC's Philadelphia District Office enforces federal employment
discrimination laws and has jurisdiction over the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia and parts of New Jersey and Ohio.</p>
<p>"This agreement promotes employment justice and allows us to continue practices which are already in place - working together with the Consulate of Mexico to advance everyone's rights against discrimination," said Lewis.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the EEOC will expand its cooperation with the Mexican Consulate.  The federal agency will provide the Consulate with Spanish-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the
EEOC.  The agency will also provide representatives to meet with Mexican nationals in Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern New Jersey in order to disseminate information and conduct counseling regarding employment discrimination matters.</p>
<p>The EEOC and the Mexican Consulate will work together to regularly provide information regarding workplace discrimination on Spanish-language radio stations throughout their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment.  Further information about the agency is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
