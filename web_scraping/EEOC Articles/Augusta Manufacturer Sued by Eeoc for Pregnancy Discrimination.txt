<p>ATLANTA – In a pregnancy discrimination lawsuit recently filed, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged that Advance Industrial Maintenance &amp; Machine, Inc., a fabrication and machine shop in Augusta, Ga., violated federal law when its president fired an office worker after learning that she was pregnant.</p>
<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex or pregnancy. The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No., 1:10-cv-00124-JRH-WLB) in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement. The EEOC is seeking back pay, front pay, compensatory and punitive damages for the affected employee, as well as injunctive relief designed to stop pregnancy discrimination and prevent it from recurring in the future.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
