<h1>EEOC Sues Oran Safety Glass for Pregnancy Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Manufacturer Fired Female Employee Because She Was Pregnant, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>RICHMOND, Va. - Oran Safety Glass, Inc., a manufacturer of armored safety glass, such as bulletproof glass for use by the military and in private sector applications, violated federal law when it fired a female employee because she was pregnant,
the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed yesterday.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's complaint, Nicole Williams began working as an assistant quality control supervisor at the company's facility in Emporia, Va., around May 9, 2012.  On or about May 25, Williams learned she was pregnant.  On May
29, Williams notified the company of her pregnancy, and the company fired her on or about June 8 because she was expecting.  According to the EEOC's complaint, Williams' ability to perform her job was not affected by her pregnancy, and at the
time of her discharge she was performing her job at an acceptable level. </p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA).  The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (<em>Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission v. Oran Safety Glass, Inc.,</em> Civil Action No. 3:14-CV-00662-HEH) after first attempting to reach a voluntary pre-litigation settlement through the agency's conciliation process.  The suit seeks back pay, front pay and/or
reinstatement, compensatory damages, and punitive damages for Williams, as well as injunctive relief.</p>
<p>"No working woman should have to fear losing her job simply because she decides to have a child," said Lynette A. Barnes, regional attorney for the EEOC's Charlotte District Office.  "Employers must remember that terminating an employee
because she is pregnant violates federal law, and the EEOC will enforce that law." </p>
<p>According to its website, Oran Glass is a privately owned company headquartered in Israel.  The company has two manufacturing facilities in Israel, and one in Emporia, which is where Williams worked. </p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination.  Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
