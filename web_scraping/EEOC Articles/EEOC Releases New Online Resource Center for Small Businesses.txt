<h1>EEOC Releases New Online Resource Center for Small Businesses</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Provides User-Friendly Information on Federal Anti-Discrimination Laws, Tips for Small Businesses and Videos on Frequently Asked Compliance Questions</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) released today a new online resource center designed to help small business owners comply with the laws enforced by EEOC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/smallbusiness/">The Small Business Resource Center</a> (SBRC), located on EEOC's public website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>, provides a user-friendly one-stop
source for information on federal employment anti-discrimination laws. The Resource Center was designed for the busy small business owner who needs information both quickly and in a format that is easy to understand. In addition to providing general
information on EEOC's laws and ways in which EEOC can assist small businesses, there are also answers to frequently asked questions, guidance in making employment decisions and tips for small businesses on a variety of potential workplace
discrimination issues.</p>
<p>EEOC is also launching the first in a series of short videos for small business owners on frequently asked compliance questions. The videos feature EEOC employees from across the country addressing topics, such as responding to an EEOC
discrimination charge, and many helpful strategies for small businesses to follow when they start the hiring process.</p>
<p>The Resource Center is a product of EEOC's Small Business Task Force, which is led by Commissioner Constance S. Barker. Launched by Commissioner Barker in 2011, the task force addresses the needs of small businesses by providing ready access to
information through the use of the internet, social media and other sources that is plainly written and easy to understand. It focuses on the needs of startups and companies that may not have the ability to afford human resource professionals or
lawyers. It is the first in a series of products the task force is currently developing. A one-page fact sheet was issued in March and is available in 30 different languages. It was designed to help small business owners better understand their
responsibilities under federal employment anti-discrimination laws.</p>
<p>"Small businesses are engines for economic growth," said EEOC Chair Jenny R. Yang. "The release of this new resource is part of the agency's continuing efforts to ensure that small business owners have the tools they need to ensure equal
employment opportunity in their workplaces."</p>
<p>Commissioner Barker said, "On behalf of EEOC's Small Business Task Force, I am very pleased to announce the release of the SBRC. Startups and other small businesses continue to play an integral role in the strength of our nation's economy. It is
our responsibility as a federal government agency to help businesses understand their legal obligations under the complex and ever-changing laws and regulations we enforce. We want small businesses to be able to quickly and easily access the
information they need to comply with the laws. It is our hope that the Small Business Resource Center will help them do just that, so that they can focus their time and efforts on growing their businesses and creating new jobs."</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Additional information about the Commission is available on its website, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
