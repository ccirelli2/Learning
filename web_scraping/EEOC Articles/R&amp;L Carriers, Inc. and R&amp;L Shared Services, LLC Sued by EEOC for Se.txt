<h1>R&amp;L Carriers, Inc. and R&amp;L Shared Services, LLC Sued by EEOC for Sex-based Discrimination</h1>

<p>INDIANPOLIS - Wilmington, Ohio based companies, R&amp;L Carriers, Inc. and R&amp;L Shared Services, LLC, refused to hire qualified females as dockworkers/loaders in violation of federal law, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
charged in a lawsuit today.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's suit, the Defendants conducted practices that included, but were not limited to, refusing to hire women as dockworkers or loaders.  This not only deprived, but deterred female applicants from applying for positions not
traditionally held by women and otherwise adversely affected their status because of their sex.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 1:17-cv-00515-SJD) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Cincinnati Division, after first attempting to
reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. In its suit, the EEOC seeks compensatory and punitive damages, backpay, and injunctive relief.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a> .</p></div>
