<h1>EEOC Seeks Public Input on Plan to Review its Significant Regulations</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today that it is inviting the public to provide input on its ongoing review of significant existing EEOC regulations to determine whether they should be modified,
streamlined, expanded, or repealed.  The review is conducted pursuant to Executive Order (EO) 13563, "Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review," found at 76 Fed. Reg. 3821 (Jan. 21, 2011).  Comments may be submitted to <a href="mailto:Public.Comments.RegulatoryReview@eeoc.gov">Public.Comments.RegulatoryReview@eeoc.gov</a> through <strong>April 20, 2015</strong>.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13563 directed federal agencies to develop preliminary plans for periodically reviewing significant regulations.  The goal is to make agencies' regulatory programs more effective in achieving their regulatory objectives and
less burdensome to the public.</p>
<p>In July 2011, the EEOC developed a <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/regulations/retro_review_plan_final.cfm">Final Plan for Retrospective Review of Significant Regulations</a>.  The EEOC has since submitted Retrospective Regulatory Review
status reports semi-annually, at the request of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  In its most recent <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/regulations/retro_review_status_report_2-15.cfm">timeline for retrospective review</a>,
published today, the EEOC projects the agency's retrospective regulatory review activities through 2023.</p>
<p>The EEOC invites members of the public to provide feedback on the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which regulations and/or reporting requirements should the EEOC consider for review, modification, streamlining, expansion or elimination, and why?</li>
<li>Are any EEOC regulations and/or reporting requirements outdated, ineffective, insufficient, inconsistent, redundant, duplicative or excessively burdensome? </li>
<li>Are there alternative regulatory approaches for particular EEOC regulations and/or reporting requirements that would reduce the burden on regulated entities while maintaining the same level of protection for applicants, employees, employers,
employment agencies, federal agencies, and unions?  If so, please describe.</li>
</ul>
<p>The EEOC welcomes feedback on these or any other retrospective regulatory review matters within the EEOC's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Public input on the EEOC's retrospective regulatory review efforts may be submitted to <a href="mailto:Public.Comments.RegulatoryReview@eeoc.gov">Public.Comments.RegulatoryReview@eeoc.gov</a> through April 20, 2015.<strong> </strong>
Regarding any EEOC regulations currently open for public comment, we encourage members of the public to submit comments through the appropriate page at <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Comments may be disclosed to the public.  While private or personally identifying infor­mation will be redacted, please do not include any information in submitted comments that you would not want made public.</p>
