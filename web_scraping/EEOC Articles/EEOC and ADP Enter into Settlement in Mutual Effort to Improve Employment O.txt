<h1>EEOC and ADP Enter into Settlement in Mutual Effort to Improve Employment Opportunities for Minorities in Illinois</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>CHICAGO - ADP, LLC, a leading payroll processing and human resource management outsourcing provider, has agreed to voluntarily resolve employment discrimination charges filed in Illinois with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC), the federal agency announced today. As the result of successful conciliation efforts between the parties, ADP has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 million and to further enhance its recruitment, hiring and promotion of minorities at its
Illinois-based operations. ADP has also agreed to periodically inform EEOC on its future efforts to expand employment opportunities for minority applicants and employees.</p>
<p>This agreement resolves charges filed with EEOC alleging that black and Hispanic individuals were discriminated against by ADP. The matter has now been resolved without any admission by ADP that it engaged in any violation.</p>
<p>"We commend ADP's willingness to continue examining its recruitment, hiring and promotion practices to ensure that any potential roadblocks to employment and advancement are removed," said EEOC Chicago District Director Julianne Bowman. "We are
particularly pleased to have achieved these results through a cooperative process of conciliation with ADP throughout our investigation, without having to resort to protracted investigation or litigation."</p>
<p>ADP Chief Diversity &amp; Corporate Social Responsibility Officer Rita Mitjans said, "While ADP believes that it has fully complied with the law, we chose to settle this matter to avoid the additional time, expense and distraction of EEOC
proceedings, and to put this matter behind us so we can focus on serving our clients and growing our business opportunities in the Chicago area and beyond.  ADP is proud of its progress and commitment to diversity and inclusion.  We are
pleased that, working together with EEOC, ADP's commitment to equal employment opportunity is reaffirmed. This voluntary agreement further advances ADP's long-established goal to actively pursue an employee base that reflects the diverse
communities it serves."</p>
<p>Eliminating barriers in recruitment and hiring is one of six national priorities identified by EEOC's Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP).</p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on the agency's website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
