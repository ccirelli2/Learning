<h1>Analytic Stress Relieving, Inc To Pay $75,000 To Resolve Sex Based Retaliation Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>PASCAGOULA, Miss.-- Analytic Stress Relieving Inc, an industrial heat treating service company that services the petrochemical and power markets, will pay $75,000 and furnish other relief to settle a sex-based retaliation discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the agency announced today. The EEOC had charged that Analytic Stress terminated a female employee in retaliation for her complaints about sexual harassment.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s lawsuit, (Civil Action No. 1:10-cv-0478) filed September 29, 2010, in the Southern District of Mississippi, Analytic Stress Relieving Inc, terminated Ashley Maygar because she complained that an acting supervisor engaged in offensive and unwanted sexually suggestive behavior in the workplace. Sexual harassment violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It is also unlawful under Title VII to retaliate against an employee who complains about discriminatory treatment.</p>
<p>The EEOC brought the lawsuit after the agency investigated, made a finding that discrimination likely occurred, and first attempted to reach a voluntary settlement.</p>
<p>According to the consent decree settling the lawsuit, Analytic Stress will pay monetary damages of $75,000 to Maygar. The company also agreed to provide sex-based discrimination, retaliation and sexual harassment training for supervisors, post a notice for employees about discrimination and tell employees how to report discrimination.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we see retaliation as an allegation in a very large segment of the charges filed with EEOC. We intend to protect the rights of employees to complain about illegal behavior,” said Delner Franklin-Thomas, director of the EEOC’s Birmingham district office.</p>
<p>Regional Attorney C. Emanuel Smith, added, “the Commission will continue to bring cases when an employee is being discouraged from pursuing the remedies provided by our statutes.”</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov.</a></p></div>
