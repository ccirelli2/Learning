<h1>Julianne Bowman Named District Director of the EEOC's Chicago District Office</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON-Julianne Bowman, a long-time attorney at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), was named district director of the agency's Chicago District Office, Chair Jenny R. Yang has announced.</p>
<p>"It is with great pleasure that we welcome Julianne Bowman as the new director of the Chicago District Office," said Yang. "Ms. Bowman has a long and successful history with the agency's Chicago office, where she previously has
served in several positions of leadership. She no doubt will assure that the office continues its strong support of workers and employers in the years ahead."</p>
<p>Bowman joined the EEOC in 1984 as a trial attorney for the Chicago District Office. In that capacity, she served as lead counsel on <em>EEOC, et. al v. AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. (formerly Western Electric),</em> which resulted in the largest
settlement for a pregnancy discrimination suit in the history of the agency--$66 million. Promoted to enforcement manager in 1993, Bowman was instrumental in making Chicago one of the most productive districts in the country, achieving record
settlements on behalf of victims of discrimination and helping employers strengthen their workplaces.</p>
<p>Bowman served as deputy district director of the Chicago office for 15 years, prior to being named acting district director in November 2014.</p>
<p>Before joining the EEOC, Bowman worked as a litigation associate for the Chicago law firm of Jenner &amp; Block.</p>
<p>"It's an honor to take on this new role as the EEOC celebrates the opening of its doors 50 years ago," Bowman said. "Workplace discrimination continues to be a pressing issue in 2015. I pledge to honor the EEOC's 50
years of accomplishments, while continuing the fight for employment equality."  </p>
<p>The EEOC enforces the nation's laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
