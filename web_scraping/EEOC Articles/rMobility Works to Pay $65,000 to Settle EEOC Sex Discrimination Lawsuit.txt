<h1>Mobility Works to Pay $65,000 to Settle EEOC Sex Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Agency Said Employer Fired Top Sales Associate Because of Her Gender</strong></em></p>
<p>SAGINAW, Mich. - An Akron, Ohio-based van company has agreed to resolve a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>The EEOC charged that WMK, Inc., doing business as Mobility Works, engaged in sex discrimination when it unlawfully terminated a top female sales associate because of her sex, while opting to retain a male sales associate with significantly less
sales. </p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan (Case No. 1:12-CV-15588) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement
through its conciliation process.  </p>
<p>Under the terms of the three-year consent decree settling the suit, Mobility Works will pay $65,000 to the sales associate and will conduct training on Title VII for its management staff. </p>
<p>"With this resolution, Mobility Works has taken a positive step towards protecting the rights of women in the workplace," said EEOC Regional Attorney Laurie Young.  </p>
<p>EEOC Trial Attorney Nedra Campbell added, "Mobility Works should be commended for agreeing to resolve this case at this juncture before engaging in costly litigation."   </p>
<p>Mobility Works provides vans for wheelchair users.  The company has 14 retail stores located in seven states, and is one of the largest accessible-vehicle suppliers in the country. </p>
<p>The EEOC is the federal agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
