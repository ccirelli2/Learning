<h1>Camber Corporation Sued by EEOC for Disability and Age Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Defense Contractor Refused to Transfer Employee Due to Son's Disability, Then Fired Him, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Defense contractor Camber Corporation violated federal law when it denied an employee a transfer based on his son's medical condition and then fired him, replacing him with someone more than 20 years younger, the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a suit filed today.</p>
<p>Camber Corporation is headquartered in Huntsville, Ala. This discrimination took place in Fairfax, Va., where the employee worked for Camber at an office within the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Such alleged behavior violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The EEOC filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division after first
attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>"Employers head in the wrong direction if they make employment decisions based on an employee's association with a person with a disability or based on age," said Washington Field Office Acting Director Mindy Weinstein.</p>
<p> EEOC Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence said, "When employers violate the law, EEOC will hold them accountable."</p>
<p>The EEOC's Washington Field Office has jurisdiction over the District of Columbia and the Virginia counties of Arlington, Clarke, Fairfax, Fauquier, Frederick, Loudoun, Prince William, Stafford and Warren; and the independent Virginia cities of
Alexandria, Fairfax City, Falls Church, Manassas, Manassas Park and Winchester.</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the latest EEOC news by
