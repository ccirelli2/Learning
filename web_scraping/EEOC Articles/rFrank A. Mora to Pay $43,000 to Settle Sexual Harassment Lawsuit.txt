<h1>Frank A. Mora to Pay $43,000 to Settle Sexual Harassment Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>General  Manager of Dry Cleaning Service Routinely Asked Female Employee for Sexual  Favors, Federal Agency Says</em></strong></p>
<p>McALLEN, Texas – Frank A. Mora, individually, and as  the authorized corporate officer of Two Lac, Inc. d/b/a Oasis One Dry Cleaners,  a McAllen, Texas dry cleaning and laundry service, will pay $43,000 and provide  significant remedial relief to a former female employee who was subjected to a  sexually hostile work environment, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission (EEOC) announced today.</p>
<p>The EEOC’s suit (Civil Action  Number 7:11-cv-209) filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of  Texas, McAllen Division, charged that a female employee at Oasis Dry Cleaners  routinely experienced sexual harassment from its general manager who solicited  sexual favors and often approached her speaking in a suggestive manner and  placing his hands on her body.</p>
<p>Such alleged behavior violates  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits sex discrimination,  including sexual harassment.  The EEOC  filed suit after first attempting to settle the case through its conciliation  process.</p>
<p>In addition to  providing $43,000 in monetary damages to the former employee, the two-year  Consent Decree resolving the case enjoins Frank A. Mora, individually, and as  the authorized corporate officer of Two Lac, Inc. d/b/a Oasis One Dry Cleaners  from discriminating against employees based on sex and requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adoption, implementation and distribution of a  bilingual Spanish/English sexual harassment and retaliation policy;</li>
<li>Two hours of bilingual Spanish/English training  to all employees, officials, managers and supervisors working at the dry  cleaning facility located at 120 E. Nolana, McAllen, Texas; and</li>
<li>Posting notices in Spanish and English of the  intent to comply with Title VII.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Employees have a legal right to go  to work every day without the anxiety of being subjected to harassment related  to their gender,” said EEOC Senior Trial Attorney David Rivela of the agency’s  San Antonio Field Office.  “We are  pleased that Mr. Mora is taking the steps necessary to provide a  discrimination-free environment for his personnel.”</p>
<p>Janet Elizondo, Acting District  Director for the Dallas District Office which oversees San Antonio, said, “I  think this case is a great example of how the Commission remains diligent in  its enforcement efforts to root out sexual harassment in the workplace.”</p>
<p>Judith G. Taylor, Supervisory Trial  Attorney of the  San Antonio Field Office, added, “Here,  the employer’s hiring a family member to manage day-to-day operations appears  to have resulted in the failure to acknowledge or address an employee’s  complaint that the family member was engaging in sexually harassing  conduct.  Businesses should exercise care  to avoid discriminatory actions or inactions motivated by familiarity.”</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2011, 11,364 charges  of sexual harassment were filed with the EEOC and state or local agencies  nationwide.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws  prohibiting employment discrimination.   Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency’s web site  at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov.</a></p></div>
