<h1>River View Coal Sued by EEOC for Race Discrimination</h1>

<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. – A Kentucky coal mine violated federal law by denying employment to black applicants at its Union County, Ky., mine, according to a lawsuit filed (date) by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, a class of qualified black applicants were denied jobs in underground mining positions at River View Coal’s Waverly, Ky., mine since at least August 2008 because of their race.</p>
<p>Making employment decisions based on race violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit (Case No. 4: 11-cv-117 ) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, Owensboro Division, after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement. The agency is seeking back pay, compensatory and punitive damages against River View Coal, as well as other relief, including a permanent injunction to prevent the company from engaging in future hiring discrimination.</p>
<p>“Employers must choose employees based on their qualifications, and not on the color of their skin,” said Laurie A. Young, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Indianapolis District Office.</p>
<p>River View Coal, LLC is a subsidiary of Alliance Resource Partners, LP. According to the company website, Alliance is the fourth-largest eastern U.S. coal producer, operating nine mining complexes in three operating regions: Illinois Basin, Central Appalachia, and Northern Appalachia. Production began at the River View mine in 2009 and 5.9 million tons of coal was produced in 2010.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
