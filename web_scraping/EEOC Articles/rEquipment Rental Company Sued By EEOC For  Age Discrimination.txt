<h1>Equipment Rental Company Sued By EEOC For  Age Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Rental Pro Fired Employee Because of His Age, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Rental Pro, a miscellaneous equipment rental company located in Somerset, Ky. - with locations also in Hazard, London and Pikeville, Ky. - violated federal law by firing an employee because of his age, the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed today.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's suit, Rental Pro terminated Ronald Johnson because of his age. Johnson was 52 years of age at the time of his termination. According to the lawsuit, the company's owner sought "younger and peppier" employees and wanted to
bring "young blood" into the company.</p>
<p>The suit was brought pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 6:15-cv-00154-GRVT) in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky after first attempting to reach a
pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. In its suit, EEOC seeks back pay and liquidated damages for Johnson as well as injunctive relief.</p>
<p>"As the statute makes clear, discrimination on the basis of a person's age is a violation of federal law," said Laurie Young, regional attorney for EEOC's Indianapolis District. "We are committed to the elimination of age discrimination in the
workplace."</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on the agency's web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
