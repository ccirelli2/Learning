<h1>Majestic Steel and EEOC Reach Agreement to Resolve Discrimination Charge</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>CLEVELAND - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Majestic Steel USA, a family-owned steel distributor based in Cleveland, have reached a voluntary conciliation agreement to resolve allegations of race and gender
discrimination raised by a former employee under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal agency announced today.</p>
<p>Following an investigation, the EEOC found that it was probable that between 2012 and 2014, the company discriminated in its hiring practices on the basis of gender by failing to hire females into the position of material handler 1, and on the
basis of race by failing to hire African-Americans into the positions of Web developer and receptionist/office specialist.</p>
<p>To demonstrate their support of Title VII and without admitting liability, the company will pay a monetary settlement to affected parties; hire qualified external trainers to conduct anti-discrimination training for all employees; and implement
new recruiting tools and resources to attract candidates of the classes identified for open positions.</p>
<p>"We commend Majestic Steel for their cooperation in working with the EEOC to resolve this matter," said Kevin Berry, acting director of EEOC's Philadelphia District, of which Cleveland is a part. "This agreement is a step toward addressing
concerns regarding access to job opportunities for women and African-Americans in an industry where those opportunities have historically been limited."</p>
<p>EEOC Cleveland Field Office Director Cheryl Mabry added, "This agreement shows that we are willing to work with employers to establish policies and practices that ensure equal opportunity, and I applaud Majestic Steel for their efforts."</p>
<p>Susan Suvak, chief financial officer of Majestic Steel, said, "Our company believes in inclusive­ness. One of our key values is 'togetherness,' which we define as focusing on the 'we,' and we believe a diverse team makes our company better. We
are committed to making sure our recruitment and hiring practices are inclusive, and that every member of our team is treated with respect."</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">http://www.eeoc.gov/</a>.  Stay connected with the latest EEOC
