<h1>EEOC Sues Nevada Health Centers and Ultracare Las Vegas for Sex Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Qualified  Male Ultrasound Technician Discharged Because of Gender, Federal Agency Says</em></strong></p>
<p>LAS VEGAS - Nevada Health Centers, Inc. and Ultracare Las  Vegas violated federal law when they discharged a qualified male ultrasound  technician because of his gender, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission (EEOC)
charged in a lawsuit it filed today.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's suit, Ultracare  Las Vegas hired David Matlock as an ultrasound technician and assigned him to  work for Nevada Health Centers, Inc. as part of a contract between the two  companies whereby Ultracare Las Vegas
provided ultrasound technicians at Nevada  Health Centers, Inc. facilities. One of Matlock's many duties was to perform  transvaginal ultrasounds. Matlock performed his job without complaint. Eventually,  Nevada Health Centers, Inc.
requested that Matlock be replaced by a female  ultrasound technician and Ultracare Las Vegas acceded to the request by  discharging Matlock and providing a female replacement.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates prohibitions against sex  discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. EEOC filed its  suit against the two companies in U.S. District Court for the District of  Nevada (Case No.
2:16-cv-1495) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation  settlement through its conciliation process. EEOC's suit seeks back pay,  benefits and punitive damages for Matlock as well as injunctive relief intended  to prevent
further discrimination by the two companies.  </p>
<p> "Sex discrimination  is simply unlawful for good reasons -- it creates roadblocks to equal  employment opportunities," said Anna Park, regional attorney for EEOC's Los  Angeles District, which includes Nevada in its
jurisdiction. "Employers need to  ensure that such gender preferences do not result in sex discrimination, which  inhibits a person's ability to be employed."</p>
<p>Richard Burgamy, local director of EEOC's Las Vegas Local  Office, said, "We see sex discrimination occurring in all types of workplaces, and  employers need to realize that EEOC is fully committed to eradicating this form  of
unlawful conduct against anyone."</p>
<p>EEOC is the federal government  agency responsible for enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws in the  workplace. Further information about EEOC is available on the agency's website  at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
