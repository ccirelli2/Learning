<div align="left"><p>ATLANTA - Antonette Sewell has been appointed as regional attorney for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) Atlanta District effective Dec. 12, the agency announced today.</p>
<p>Sewell has been a civil rights litigator in both New York and Georgia for almost two decades. Immediately prior to joining EEOC, Sewell was general counsel for the Georgia Department of Community Affairs, where she provided legal guidance on a

and employment, and at Legal Services of New York, where she worked on systemic housing litigation. Throughout her career, Sewell has been dedicated to social justice, and in particular creating meaningful access for individuals living with
disabilities as well as equal opportunity in education, employment and affordable housing.</p>
<p>"The work done by the committed team at EEOC is vital to our country, our citizens and our founding principles of fairness and equality for all," said Sewell. "I am excited to lend my litigation and leadership experience to the impactful and
positive advocacy work being done in the Atlanta District to eradicate employment discrimination."</p>
<p>EEOC Deputy General Counsel James Lee said, "Antonette is an experienced leader and manager. She has demonstrated a commitment to social justice and the advancement of civil rights in her past work. I am confident that her experience and skills
