EEOC's operations in California's San Diego and Imperial Counties. </p>
<p>"We are fortunate that Christopher Green has taken the helm to promote our mission to stop and remedy illegal employment discrimination in the greater San Diego region," said Rosa M. Viramontes, district director for EEOC's Los Angeles District,
which oversees the San Diego Local Office.  "He brings incredible expertise from years of experience as a dedicated investigator in Northern California.  Since he previously lived in San Diego, we know that Christopher will meld his
investigative expertise, commitment to civil rights and firsthand knowledge of San Diego to the job."</p>
<p>A California native, Green began his career as a community organizer, assisting immigrant communities.  Bilingual in Spanish and English, he also spent time working for non-governmental organizations in Central and South America.  He
graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a bachelor's degree in Latin American Studies.  He continued his career with EEOC starting in 2009 as an investigator.  As such, he successfully investigated cases involving
sexual harassment, wage discrimination, systemic implications and immigrant, migrant and vulnerable workers.  </p>
<p>Green said, "It is a privilege to serve the diverse communities throughout San Diego and Imperial Counties to ensure that the civil rights of workers are protected.  Situated close to the U.S. and Mexico border, our office has a unique set
of issues to investigate.  We are committed to both eradicating employment discrimination and educating employers on how to best comply with federal anti-discrimination laws." </p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  The EEOC's San Diego Local Office is located at 555 W. Beech Street, Suite 504, San Diego, CA 92101. For assistance, call the EEOC at 1-800-669-4000 or
