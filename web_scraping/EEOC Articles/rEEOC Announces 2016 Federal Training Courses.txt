<p>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Office of Federal Operations (OFO), today announced the issuance of the 2016 Federal Training Course Calendar, which includes two new courses: <em>Special Emphasis Program
Manager</em> and <em>Unlawful Harassment: An Agency Responsibility</em>. The full calendar is available online on the <a href="https://secure.kinsail.com/results.asp?p=eeoc&amp;pt=store&amp;GroupID=41002">EEOC Training Institute's website</a>.</p>
<p>EEOC offers a variety of expert training geared specifically for federal employees and managers. The interactive courses are also ideal for equal employment opportunity (EEO) counselors and investigators, agency representatives and attorneys, as

<p>"Proactive prevention is the best medicine to stop discrimination before it starts," said Carlton M. Hadden, director of EEOC's Office of Federal Operations (OFO). "Therefore, we encourage the federal sector community to learn from the experts
