with disabilities.  </p>
<p>Federal employees and members of the public are encouraged to participate by submitting questions and comments using the hashtag <strong>#5084FEDs</strong>. <strong> </strong> The EEOC invites queries and comments regarding the common

<p>Carlton Hadden, director of EEOC's Office of Federal Operations, said, "Our Twitter chat will gather feedback from all stakeholders on 508 compliance in the federal sector. While we certainly want information about best practices, we also need
information on any barriers to fostering greater accessibility."</p>
