<p>PHOENIX —  Casey Jones Grill discriminated against female bartenders and servers by subjecting them to sexual harassment in the form of lewd comments and sex-based derogatory name-calling, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed today in federal court.  Casey Jones Grill, which is operated by Los Muchachos, LLC, is located on Thunderbird Road in West Phoenix.<br/>
</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, CIV 2:10-cv-02079 MHM, the restaurant’s owner, Nick Karendreas, was the principal harasser of the female employees, who were routinely called harassing and vulgar names, including “stupid bitch” and who were regularly subjected to unwelcome sexually-offensive remarks.  The complaint further alleges that the female employees were subjected to sexist and demeaning treatment and that female employees were forced to resign because of the intolerable, hostile working conditions or they were terminated based on their gender. </p>
<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, protects workers from discrimination based upon gender, including sexual harassment.  The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement.  The lawsuit seeks lost wages and compensatory and punitive damages for the harassment victims, as well as appropriate injunctive relief to prevent discriminatory practices in the future.<br/>
