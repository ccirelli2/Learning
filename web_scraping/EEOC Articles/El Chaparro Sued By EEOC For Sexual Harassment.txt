<h1>El Chaparro Sued By EEOC For Sexual Harassment</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Owner Sexually Harassed Four Servers at Greensboro Tex-Mex Restaurant, EEOC Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>ATLANTA - El Chaparro, Inc. violated federal law when one of its male owners sexually harassed four female servers at its Greensboro, Ga., Tex-Mex restaurant, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed
today. Although the Greensboro restaurant has closed, El Chaparro currently operates another Tex-Mex restaurant by the same name in Covington, Ga.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's suit, in 2013 and 2014, El Chaparro's general manager and co-owner showed the four servers pictures and videos containing sexual images, talked about the servers' sex lives, and showed the servers shirtless photos of himself
on a regular, sometimes daily, basis. The servers complained about the sexual harassment to the restaurant's co-owner, but the company failed to take any action to stop the harassment. The four women are no longer employed by El Chaparro.</p>
<p>These alleged actions violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on sex, including by subjecting them to a sexually hostile work environment. EEOC filed suit (<em>EEOC
v. El Chaparro, Inc.</em>, Civil Action No. 1:16-cv-4118-RWS-CMS) in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. EEOC is
seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the former servers, as well as injunctive relief designed to prevent future discrimination.</p>
<p>"Sexual harassment in the restaurant industry is a form of misconduct that, unfortunately, EEOC sees regularly," said Bernice Williams-Kimbrough, district director for EEOC's Atlanta District Office. "The fact that it was a proprietor of the
restaurant who allegedly subjected the four servers to sexual harassment makes the conduct even more intolerable."</p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
