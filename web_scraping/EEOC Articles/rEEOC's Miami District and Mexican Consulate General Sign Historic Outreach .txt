</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>MOU Will Provide Mexican Nationals with Employment Information and Guidance</strong></em></p>
<p>MIAMI---The Miami District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today with the Consulate General of Mexico in Miami.  The agreement establishes an ongoing
collaboration between these entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace regardless of immigration status.  Mexican Consul General Jose Antonio
Zabalgoitia Trejo and EEOC Miami District Office Acting Director Ozzie L. Black, Jr., signed the agreement.  </p>
<p>"By signing this Memorandum of Understanding today with the Mexican Consulate General, we solidify our continued and longstanding commitment to this underserved community," said Black.  "This agreement provides the opportunity for ongoing
education, outreach and service by EEOC to Mexican nationals in our area.  We look forward to a long-lasting and significant partnership."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the MOU, EEOC will expand its relationship with the consulate by providing them with Spanish-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the federal agency.  In addition, EEOC will partner with the consulate general
office to provide information and training to areas of the state where migrant farm workers and other Mexican nationals live and work.  </p>
<p>EEOC's Miami District Office is comprised of the Miami, Tampa and San Juan EEOC offices and has jurisdiction over Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   </p>
<p>EEOC offices in both Miami and Tampa are currently involved in plans for the agency's participation in various "Labor Rights Week" events, which began on August 31 and are scheduled throughout the state.  "Labor Rights Week" is an initiative
to educate Mexican nationals and other Latinos about their civil rights, workplace safety, minimum wage laws and human trafficking.    </p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination.  Further information is available at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
