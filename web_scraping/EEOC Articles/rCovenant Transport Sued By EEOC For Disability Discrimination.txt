<h1>Covenant Transport Sued By EEOC For Disability Discrimination</h1>

<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Trucking Company Refused to Hire Applicant Because of His Disability, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. -- Covenant Transport, Inc., a trucking company headquartered in Chattanooga, Tenn., violated federal law by refusing to hire an applicant because of his disability, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
charged in a lawsuit filed yesterday.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's lawsuit, the applicant applied for employment as a commercial driver. Covenant conditionally approved his application pending a license check and drug screening. The applicant told Covenant's representative he was unable to
provide a urine sample due to a medical condition, bladder exstrophy, but could provide blood for the drug screening. Exstrophy of the bladder is a congenital absence of a portion of the abdominal wall and bladder wall.</p>
<p>Covenant initially agreed to the blood screening and later decided not to hire the applicant because of his medical condition and the fact that he could not provide a valid urine specimen. Covenant withdrew the offer of conditional employment.
EEOC's suit also claims the company knew the applicant could not provide a valid urine specimen due to his medical condition and refused to provide him the opportunity to undergo drug screening because of his disability.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits employers from refusing to hire an applicant because of a disability. EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, (Civil
Action No. 1:16-cv-00142) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The federal agency seeks back pay, compensatory damages and punitive damages for the claimant, as well as injunctive relief.</p>
<p>"EEOC remains as committed as ever to enforcing the ADA to remove barriers to employment for persons with disabilities," said Katharine W. Kores, district director for the Memphis District Office.</p>
<p>According to its website, Covenant Transport, founded in 1986, operates as a premium transportation service provider specializing in critical, hazmat, government, Canadian and Mexican shipments.</p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
