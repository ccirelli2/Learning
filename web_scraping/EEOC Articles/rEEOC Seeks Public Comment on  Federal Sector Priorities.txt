<h1>EEOC Seeks Public Comment on  Federal Sector Priorities</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Agency's New Strategic Enforcement Plan Calls for Federal Sector Complement</em></strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today announced that it is seeking public comment regarding its priorities in its federal sector program as part of the agency's recently approved Strategic Enforcement Plan for
Fiscal Years 2013-2016 (<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/sep.cfm" id="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/sep.cfm|">SEP</a>).</p>
<p>The SEP mandated that the agency "determine how enforcement priorities for the federal sector will be reflected in the federal sector case management system." In addition, the plan "should address how enforcement priorities will be incorporated
into the forthcoming integrated data system, which will be used to identify and address potentially discriminatory policies or practices in federal agencies."</p>
<p>EEOC is asking for public input as it prepares the Federal Sector Complement Plan (FCP) to the SEP. EEOC's Offices of Federal Operations and Field Programs are jointly developing the FCP, which will address at least three major areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determining how the EEOC's federal sector program will implement the SEP priorities.</li>
<li>Identifying specific federal sector enforcement priorities and strategies for addressing them.</li>
<li>Recommending strategies to improve communication, oversight, and consistency across the federal sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commission approved the SEP to establish national enforcement priorities and better integrate enforcement responsibilities. The SEP grew out of the EEOC's <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/strategic_plan_12to16.cfm" id="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/strategic_plan_12to16.cfm|">Strategic Plan</a> for Fiscal Years 2012-2016, which the Commission approved on February 22, 2012. The SEP is the result of unprecedented public and staff input, including a <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/meetings/7-18-12/index.cfm" id="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/meetings/7-18-12/index.cfm|">Commission meeting</a> at which more than 30 stakeholders testified.</p>
<p>EEOC encourages input from individuals, advocacy groups, agency stakeholders, employers, and other interested parties. The Commission will carefully review each submission for possible inclusion in the FCP. Suggestions may be sent via email to <a href="mailto:fcp@eeoc.gov" id="mailto:fcp@eeoc.gov|">fcp@eeoc.gov</a> and must be submitted no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on January 24, 2013. Each submission should contain contact information.</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
