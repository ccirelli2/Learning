<p>CLEVELAND – A Medina, Ohio manufacturer of fasteners and fastening will pay $245,000 and furnish other relief to settle a national origin discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division (Case No. 1:08-cv-02271), two Hispanic machinists at SFS Intec were denied training opportunities that were regularly made available to non-Hispanic employees. The EEOC’s investigation revealed that the two machinists were subjected to condescending and offensive comments with respect to their national origin, Puerto Rican. The Hispanic machinists were also the only two employees who lost their jobs when SFS Intec implemented a reduction in force at its Medina facility in July, 2007.</p>
<p>In addition to monetary relief, the consent decree settling the suit provides that SFS Intec will provide training to all supervisors and managers employed at its Medina plant regarding Title VII’s requirements and policies regarding compliance with the statute. SFS Intec will also post a notice informing employees of its commitment to compliance with the statute.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased that this employer is taking proactive measures to ensure a discrimination-free workplace in the future by addressing the problems that led to the lawsuit,” said EEOC Acting Regional Attorney Debra Lawrence.</p>
<p>According to company’s web site, SFS Intec, headquartered in Wyomissing, Pa., has manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio and maintains service centers in California, Georgia, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Texas. SFS Intec has 400 employees.</p>

The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</div>
