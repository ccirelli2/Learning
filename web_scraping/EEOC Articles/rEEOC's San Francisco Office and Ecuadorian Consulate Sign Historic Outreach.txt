</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Federal Agency and Consulate Partner to Educate Ecuadorian Workers On Their Employment Rights</strong></em></p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO - The San Francisco District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Consulate of Ecuador in San Francisco today.  The agreement establishes a
partnership between the agency and consulate to inform Ecuadorian nationals working in the United States about their employment rights and the federal laws that protect workers from discrimination, regardless of documentation status.  </p>
<p>Ecuadorian Consular Agent Fidel Jiron Cruz and Michael Baldonado, director of the EEOC's San Francisco District Office, signed the agreement.  Under its terms, the EEOC and the Ecuadorian Consulate will work together to regularly provide
information regarding workplace discrimination and harassment through joint educational sessions to workers and on Spanish-language radio stations throughout their respective jurisdictions.  They will distribute Spanish-language materials
explaining the laws enforced by the EEOC, and conduct training to consulate staff about the EEOC and the laws it enforces. </p>
<p>"Protecting immigrant, migrant and other vulnerable workers, who may be unaware of their rights under equal employment laws, is one of six national priorities identified by the EEOC's Strategic Enforcement Plan," said Baldonado.  "We are
honored to work together with the Consulate of Ecuador to advance everyone's rights against discrimination."</p>
<p>The Ecuadorian Consulate in San Francisco provides services to Ecuadorian nationals residing in Alaska, Montana, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, northern California and northern Nevada.  Further information is available at <a href="http://www.consuladodelecuadorsf.com" id="http://www.consuladodelecuadorsf.com|">http://www.consuladodelecuadorsf.com</a>.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination, and EEOC's San Francisco District Office has jurisdiction over the states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, northern California and northern
Nevada.  Further information is available at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
