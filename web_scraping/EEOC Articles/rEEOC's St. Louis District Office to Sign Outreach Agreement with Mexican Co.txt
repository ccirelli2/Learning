<p>ST. LOUIS - The St. Louis District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Consulate of Mexico for Kansas City on Wednesday, Dec.10, the agency announced
today.  The signing will take place at the Consulate of Mexico's office at 1617 Baltimore Avenue at 12:00 p.m.    Head Consul Alicia Guadalupe Kerber Palma and the EEOC's St. Louis District Director James R. Neely, Jr. will sign
the agreement.</p>
<p>The agreement will establish an ongoing collaborative relationship between these two entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance and access to education and training resources to help them exercise their workplace
rights.  This agreement is also a key objective of the EEOC's Strategic Enforcement Plan, which includes protecting the rights of immigrants, migrant and other vulnerable workers.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the EEOC and the consulate will launch an educational program aimed at assisting Mexican nationals to become aware of the laws that prohibit employment discrimination, as well as disseminating
compliance and educational materials to the consulate's constituency.  The EEOC and the consulate will also conduct two informational forums each calendar year and set up a system for consular contact with Mexican nationals who have returned to
Mexico and are owed monetary compensation the EEOC has collected from the responsible employers.</p>
<p>The Mexican Consulate in Kansas City provides services to preserve the rights of Mexican nationals residing in Missouri as well as other areas in the Midwest.  The EEOC's St. Louis District Office enforces federal employment discrimination
laws and has jurisdiction over Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and 16 counties in southern Illinois. </p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment.  Further information about the agency is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov in both English and Spanish or by calling its toll free number at
1-800-669-4000.  The EEOC's toll-free TTY number is 1-800-669-6820.<br/>
