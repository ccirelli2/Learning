<p>NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Field Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Consulate of Mexico in New Orleans on March 14.  The agreement establishes an
ongoing collaborative relationship between these two entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace, regardless of documentation status.  Andrea
García Guerra, consul of Mexico in New Orleans, and Keith T. Hill, director of EEOC's New Orleans Field Office, will sign the agreement.</p>
<p>The Mexican Consulate in New Orleans provides services to preserve the rights of Mexican nationals residing in Louisiana.  The EEOC's New Orleans Field Office enforces federal employment discrimination laws and has jurisdiction over the
entire State of Louisiana.  </p>
<p>"A Memorandum of Understanding promotes employment justice and allows us to continue current practices which are in place," said Hill.  </p>
<p>Under the terms of the MOU, the EEOC will expand its cooperation with the Mexican Consulate, providing it with Spanish-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the EEOC.  The agency will also provide representatives to meet with
Mexican nationals in Louisiana in order to disseminate information and conduct counseling regarding employment discrimination matters.</p>
<p>The EEOC and the Mexican Consulate will work together regularly to provide information regarding workplace discrimination on Spanish-language radio stations throughout their respective jurisdictions. </p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment. Further information about the agency is available by calling 1-800-669-4000 and on its website at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
