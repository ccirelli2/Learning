<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Pact Establishes Ongoing Collaborative Relationship Between the Two Entities</em></strong></p>
<p>SAN JUAN, P.R. -- The Miami District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in San Juan today with the Office of the Women's Advocate of Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto
Rico. The agreement establishes an ongoing collaboration between these entities to provide women with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace. Ombudsman Wanda Vazquez, Esq., and William R.
Sanchez, who represented the Miami District Office in his capacity as EEOC San Juan Local Office director, signed the agreement.</p>
<p>"EEOC's San Juan Local Office is very proud to join forces with the Office of the Women's Advocate of Puerto Rico in our efforts to achieve equal opportunity for women in the workplace," said Sanchez. "This agreement represents a giant step
forward in this effort."</p>
<p>Under the MOU's terms, EEOC will expand its relationship with the Office of the Women's Advocate by collaborating with efforts to provide women throughout the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with education and training to help them exercise their
workplace rights. These efforts include providing English, Spanish and Creole-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the federal agency and how they may file discrimination charges with EEOC.</p>
<p>EEOC's Miami District Office is comprised of the Miami, Tampa and San Juan EEOC offices, and has jurisdiction over Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
