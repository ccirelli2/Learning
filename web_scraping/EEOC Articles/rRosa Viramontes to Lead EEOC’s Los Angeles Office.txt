</div>
<div align="left"><p>LOS ANGELES - Jenny R. Yang, Chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), announced on Jan. 8 the selection of Rosa Viramontes, a long-term EEOC employee, as the new director of its Los Angeles District Office. The EEOC's Los
Angeles District Office encompasses central and southern California, southern Nevada, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories of Guam, American Samoa, Wake Islands and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>"It is with great pleasure that I introduce Rosa Viramontes as the new director of the Los Angeles District Office," said Chair Yang. "Ms. Viramontes has deep ties in the Los Angeles community, and she brings a wealth of experience with the
Commission and knowledge to this very important position."</p>
<p>Viramontes joined the EEOC in 1978 as a clerk typist. Thereafter Viramontes served in several support and administrative positions including personnel clerk, director's secretary and personnel management specialist before moving to the
enforcement area as an investigator. After serving as an investigator for a number of years, Viramontes held various senior-level investigative and supervisory positions, including systemic investigator, systemic and enforcement supervisor and
program analyst. In 1997 Viramontes advanced to the management ranks where she has served in various capacities including enforcement manager, deputy director, and acting district director. During her tenure with EEOC, Viramontes has been the
recipient of numerous agency awards, including the 2012 EEOC Chair's Award for Commitment to Excellence, the highest honor bestowed on EEOC staff.</p>
<p>"The fire to fight for the disenfranchised began early in my life as a community organizer, advocating for low-income communities in East Los Angeles," Viramontes said. "I am thankful that in my career at the EEOC, I was able to continue the
fight against injustice in the employment arena.  It is my honor to now lead the Los Angeles District in the Commission's mission to stop and remedy unlawful discrimination in the workplace."</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. The EEOC's Los Angeles District Office is located at 255 E. Temple Street, 4th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90012. For assistance, call the EEOC at 1-800-669-4000
