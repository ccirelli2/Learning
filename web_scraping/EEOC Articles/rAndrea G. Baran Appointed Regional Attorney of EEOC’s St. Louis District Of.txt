<h1>Andrea G. Baran Appointed Regional Attorney of EEOC’s St. Louis District Office</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON - Andrea G. Baran, a 15-year attorney with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), has been appointed regional attorney of the agency's St. Louis District, which includes offices in St. Louis, Kansas City and Oklahoma
City, the agency announced today.</p>
<p>A graduate of Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, Baran began her career at the EEOC in 1999 as a trial attorney in the agency's Kansas City Area Office. In 2010 she became a supervisory trial attorney in the Phoenix District
Office. She has litigated many cases during her time with the EEOC, recovering millions of dollars for victims of discrimination and obtaining changes to employers' policies and practices to prevent future discriminatory treatment. Baran has also
tried jury cases in Missouri, Kansas, and Arizona involving sexual harassment, age and race discrimination, retaliation, and national origin harassment. She has been a frequent speaker regarding the EEOC and employment discrimination and has trained
lawyers and EEOC investigators regarding trial practice, negotiations, systemic discrimination, and other issues.</p>
<p>"Throughout Ms. Baran's legal career, she has demonstrated her commitment to fighting employment discrimination," said EEOC General Counsel David Lopez. "She has a superior understanding of the geographical jurisdiction of the St. Louis District
Office and pre-existing strong relationships with the plaintiffs' bar and some non-profit advocacy groups. I look forward to working with her as she takes on this new position."</p>
<p>Baran said, "I look forward to returning to the St. Louis District and continuing the agency's work to eradicate discrimination and ensure equal opportunities for all workers. I am honored by General Counsel Lopez's selection of me and by the
opportunity to once again serve communities in this part of the Midwest."</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. The EEOC's St. Louis District includes Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and part of Southern Illinois.
