<p>MIAMI - Delray Beach, Fla.-based Cobra Pavers &amp; Engineering, Inc. and Cobra Construction, Inc., which have two locations located in south Florida, will pay $125,000 and provide other relief to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Cobra subjected female office employees to a sexually hostile work environment which included telling stories of sexual exploits, derogatory remarks about females, inappropriate sexual comments and engaging in unwelcome touching of a sexual nature by Cobra's managerial agents. (<em>EEOC v. Cobra Pavers &amp; Engineering, Inc. and Cobra Construction, Inc.</em> Civil Action No.: 09-cv-81239). Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. The EEOC attempted to reach a voluntary settlement with the company through its conciliation process before filing suit.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the three-year consent decree resolving the lawsuit, Cobra agreed to revise its sexual harassment policy; provide training to its employees and management staff at the Delray Beach location; report biannually any new complaints of discrimination and subsequent investigations; and post a notice regarding the settlement.</p>
<p>"Sexual harassment can never be tolerated in any workplace, and the construction industry is no exception," said EEOC Regional Attorney Robert Weisberg. "Employers have an obligation under federal law to provide all of their employees with a workplace free from such misconduct. The EEOC will remain vigilant in its enforcement of that obligation."</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the agency is available on its website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>. The EEOC's Miami District Office is located at 2 South Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 2700.</p></div>
