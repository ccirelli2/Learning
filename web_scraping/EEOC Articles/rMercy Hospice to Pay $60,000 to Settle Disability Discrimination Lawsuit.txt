<h1>Mercy Hospice to Pay $60,000 to Settle Disability Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>

<p>DETROIT - Mercy Hospice, a Troy, Mich., provider of in-home hospice care for terminally ill patients and a member of Trinity Home Health Services, will pay $60,000 to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>The EEOC charged that Mercy Hospice engaged in disability discrimination by refusing to allow a nurse with multiple sclerosis to return from a medical leave with restrictions. Instead of accommodating the nurse, Mercy Hospice fired her, the EEOC
said.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (Case No. 4:12-cv-13803) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through
its conciliation process. Under the terms of the consent decree settling the suit, Mercy Hospice will pay $60,000 to the nurse and will conduct training on the ADA for its human resources and management staff.</p>
<p>"Mercy Hospice has taken a positive step toward protecting the rights of disabled employees with disabilities with this resolution," said EEOC Regional Attorney Laurie Young.</p>
<p>EEOC Trial Attorney Nedra Campbell said, "With training on the ADA, Mercy Hospice should be prepared to protect the rights of disabled employees in the future."</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
