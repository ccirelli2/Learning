</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: left">BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Marsha Rucker, who has served as an attorney with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for eight years, has been appointed regional attorney for EEOC's Birmingham District Office
effective Dec. 1, the federal agency announced today.</p>
<p>Rucker began her career with EEOC as a trial attorney in 2008. She has served as an EEOC supervisory trial attorney since May 2015. Rucker has litigated many cases during her time with EEOC to successful resolution. She was lead counsel in
<em>EEOC v. WilcoHess</em>, a class sexual harassment case against a travel plaza and convenience store operator which was resolved by a $215,000 consent decree.</p>
<p>Before coming to EEOC, Rucker had over 15 years of experience in litigating matters involving labor/employment law and fair housing. She was in-house counsel for two large public housing authorities in Ohio and Pennsylvania and a staff attorney
for the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland.</p>
<p>"Marsha has demonstrated over the past decade her skills and commitment to justice and the advancement of civil rights," said EEOC General Counsel David Lopez. "With this new appointment, the Birmingham District is poised to maintain a strong
prosecutorial program of enforcing this nation's anti-discrimination laws."</p>
<p>Rucker said, "I am most grateful for the opportunity to serve in this community, the cradle of the civil rights movement, as regional attorney. I look forward to the work ahead of ensuring that EEOC's anti-discrimination statutes are enforced and
that workers throughout the district have equal opportunity in employment."</p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. The agency's Birmingham District includes Alabama, Mississippi (except 17 northern counties) and the Florida Panhandle, with offices in Birmingham and Mobile, Ala.,
and Jackson, Miss.</p>
<p>EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the latest EEOC news by subscribing
