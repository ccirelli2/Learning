<h1>Federal Court Enters Consent Decree Ending EEOC Retaliation Lawsuit Against TRC Global Solutions</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Employee Fired in Retaliation for Complaining About Discrimination, Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>MILWAUKEE – The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today that a federal district court judge in Milwaukee has entered a consent decree resolving an employment discrimination lawsuit brought by the agency against a Milwaukee-based provider of employee relocation services.</p>
<p>The EEOC had charged in its lawsuit that TRC Global Solutions, Inc. violated federal law by firing an African-American employee, Princess Barksdale, one day after she complained to company officials that she was being subjected to discrimination and retaliation.</p>
<p>Retaliation for complaining about discrimination violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit (<em>EEOC v. TRC Global Solutions, Inc.,</em> E.D. Wis. No. 09-CV-934 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin) on September 28, 2009 after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>The decree, signed by Judge Rudolph T. Randa, provides that TRC will pay Barksdale compensation, includes a prohibition against future retaliation, and requires that TRC provide training to its employees in regard to discrimination and retaliation.</p>
<p>“Retaliation against employees who assert their rights is illegal, even if, as here, the employee does not ultimately prove the underlying discrimination,” said John C. Hendrickson, regional attorney of the EEOC’s Chicago District Office, which is responsible for EEOC litigation in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota. “All employees have the right to bring their discrimination complaints forward without fear of retaliation. We appreciate TRC’s willingness to work with us to provide relief for Ms. Barksdale and to ensure that retaliation does not recur.”</p>
<p>The case was litigated by Senior Trial Attorney Brian Tyndall of the EEOC’s Milwaukee Area Office</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information is available on the EEOC’s web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a> .</p></div>
