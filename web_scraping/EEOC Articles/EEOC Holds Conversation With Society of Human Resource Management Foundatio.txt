<p> WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today that Tina Sung from the Society for Human Resource Management Foundation (SHRM) will join with EEOC Acting Chair Victoria A. Lipnic in a "fireside chat" to
discuss employment and age diversity issues at the EEOC's 20<sup>th</sup> annual Examining Conflicts in Employment Laws (EXCEL) training conference in Chicago, June 27-29. </p>
<p>Tina Sung, SHRM Foundation board member and vice president of the Partnership for Public Service, and EEOC Acting Chair Victoria A. Lipnic will discuss the aging of the workforce and the importance of including age in diversity and inclusion
programs. Prior to joining the Partnership, Ms. Sung founded and served as president of Synergy Works LLC, which provides strategy and performance improvement consulting services to the federal government, state and local governments, NGOs and
Fortune 500 companies. She also founded a second company, Experience Matters: The Executive Transition Experts, helping senior executives facing reorganization, a new job, or retirement to make a smooth transition to the next stage of their
lives.</p>
<p>"EXCEL is the EEOC's premier annual training event," said EEOC Acting Chair Victoria A. Lipnic. "EXCEL attendees will receive cutting-edge information and the latest updates on EEO law and policy issues. This conference is a key tool for
promoting best practices in the workplace."</p>
<p>The conference theme this year is <em>Embracing the Future: People, Purpose, Passion.</em> EXCEL provides the employer community, in both federal and private sector with tools and strategies to address emerging issues in equal employment
opportunity (EEO) and foster model work­places nationwide. EXCEL includes individual agendas for the federal and private sectors, to include state and local governments. The comp­rehensive training workshops and events are geared toward EEO
managers, supervisors, practi­tioners, HR professionals, attorneys, ADR specialists and other interested stakeholders.</p>
<p>As the nation marks the 50th anniversary of the landmark Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the EEOC is also pleased that <a href="https://eeotraining.eeoc.gov/profile/web/index.cfm?PKwebID=0x368745fa&amp;varPage=info" id="https://eeotraining.eeoc.gov/profile/web/index.cfm?PKwebID=0x368745fa&amp;varPage=info|" style="">Jo Ann Jenkins</a>, chief executive officer (CEO) of AARP, will address EXCEL as well as join Chair Lipnic for a candid conversation about age and the value of
