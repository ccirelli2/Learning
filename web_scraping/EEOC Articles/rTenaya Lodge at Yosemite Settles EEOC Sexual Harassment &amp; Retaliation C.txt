<h1>Tenaya Lodge at Yosemite Settles EEOC Sexual Harassment &amp; Retaliation Case for $195,000</h1>

<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Male Supervisor Sexually Harassed a Class of Female Hotel Staff, Federal Agency Says</strong></em></p>
<p>FRESNO, Calif., - DNC Parks &amp; Resorts at Tenaya, Inc. which operates Tenaya Lodge, a hotel and resort near Yosemite National Park in California, will pay $195,000 and furnish other relief to settle a federal charge of sexual harassment and
retaliation filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today.  </p>
<p>In 2010, a female employee filed the EEOC charge of discrimination alleging that a male supervisor made sexual comments and referenced an image of a sexual nature.  The female employee further alleged that upon reporting the sexual
harassment, the male supervisor retaliated against her by issuing written discipline and treating her differently.  </p>
<p>Following an EEOC investigation, the director of EEOC's Fresno Local Office determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that the female employee was sexually harassed due to her gender, female, and that she was subjected to retaliation
for reporting the harassment, a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.  The EEOC also found reasonable cause to believe that a class of other female employees was also sexually harassed due to gender.  Tenaya Lodge denied the
allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation, and the company did not admit to liability while agreeing to settle the matter.</p>
<p>Following the EEOC's determination, the EEOC entered into a one-year conciliation agreement with Tenaya Lodge and the female employee in question.  The agreement effectively settles the case administratively, thereby avoiding
litigation.  The agreement provides for $100,000 in monetary relief for the female employee who filed the EEOC charge.  An additional $95,000 is designated as a class fund for eligible claimants who also encountered sexual harassment
and/or retaliation while working at Tenaya Lodge.  </p>
<p>Aside from the monetary relief, Tenaya Lodge will provide equal employment opportunity training for all current employees and, thereafter, for all new hires in the language that the employee understands, along with additional training for
managerial and human resources staff on how to deal with discrimination, harassment and retaliation.  Tenaya Lodge also agreed to post a notice about the settlement in English and Spanish; to report future instances of discrimination to the
EEOC; and to publicize the settlement via press release.  </p>
<p>Workers have the right to report sexual harassment or other forms discrimination on the job without negative repercussions," said Melissa Barrios, director of the EEOC's Fresno Local Office.  "We commend Tenaya Lodge for working with the
Commission to resolve this matter and for agreeing to implement measures to protect their employees from harassment, discrimination and retaliation."</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
