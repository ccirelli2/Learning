<p>LITTLE  ROCK, Ark. – Valley Motors, Inc., an  automobile dealership located in Russellville  Ark., will pay $30,000 to settle  a retaliation lawsuit brought by U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>The EEOC’s suit, Civil Action No.  4:10-cv-1420 SWW, charged that Valley Motors violated Title VII when it fired a  female sales associate after she complained that Valley Motors refused to place  her on the used car lot because of her gender.  Valley Motors fired the sales associate less than a week after receiving  her written complaint.</p>
<p>Retaliation for complaining about  discrimination violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to  reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, retaliation charges  and lawsuits have risen significantly over the last couple of years, both in  the Memphis District and across the country,” said Regional Attorney Faye A.  Williams of the EEOC’s Memphis District Office, which has jurisdiction over  Arkansas, Tennessee and portions of Mississippi. “Employers must learn that employees have a  right to complain when they think that the employer may have violated their  federally protected rights.”</p>
<p>Valley Motors, Inc. employs about  34 people, including sales associates, and sells Nissan, Hyundai, Chrysler,  Dodge, Jeep and Ram trucks.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws  prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available  on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov.</a></p></div>
