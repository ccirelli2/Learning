<p>GUAM - The federal agency tasked with enforcing laws against employment discrimination, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), today announced that registration has officially opened for its EEOC Guam Technical Assistance
Program Seminar (TAPS) for both private and public employer representatives, confirmed to take place on Sept. 10 in Tumon, Guam.</p>
<p>It has been seven years since the EEOC hosted a seminar in Guam, the last one occurring in 2007. This year's seminar will feature keynote presentations by the EEOC's Acting Los Angeles District Director, Rosa Viramontes; EEOC Supervisory
Administrative Judge, Diane Gross; and EEOC Honolulu Local Office Director, Timothy Riera. Officials from the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage &amp; Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs are also slated to present.</p>
<p>The seminar is geared toward attorneys, mediators, human resource and equal employment opportunity (EEO) professionals in the private and federal sectors, along with other interested parties. The comprehensive training sessions and workshops will
provide updates and guidance on EEO law and how to approach EEO cases the way the EEOC experts do. There is also a federal sector track for EEO professionals and attorneys representing federal agencies, along with beginning and advanced issue
workshops for all.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to return to Guam to connect with local employer representatives," said Rosa Viramontes, acting district director for the EEOC's Los Angeles District, which includes Guam in its juris­diction. "Our seminar is an opportunity to
hear firsthand from EEOC officials who will provide updates and guidance on how to address and prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation in the workplace."</p>
