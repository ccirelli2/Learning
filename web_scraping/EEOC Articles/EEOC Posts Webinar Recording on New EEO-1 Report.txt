<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has posted online a recording of its Oct. 26, 2016 webinar for employers about the new Employer Information Report or EEO-1 at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/2017survey-webinar.cfm">https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/2017survey-webinar.cfm</a>. This webinar provides an overview of the EEO-1, describes the process of reporting and submitting summary pay
and hours worked data, and gives examples of how to enter the data on the new form. A recording of the webinar, the presentation slides, and other resources related to the new EEO-1, including the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/upload/component-1-and-2-sample-2017-eeo1-report.pdf">new form</a>, a <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/2017survey-fact-sheet.cfm">Fact Sheet for Small Business</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/2017survey-qanda.cfm">questions and answers</a> document are available on <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/2017survey.cfm">EEOC's 2017 EEO-1 Survey page</a>.</p>
<p>Starting March 2018, the EEO-1 will collect summary pay and hours worked data, in addition to demographic information, from certain employers. The new information will improve investigations of possible pay discrimination, which remains a
contributing factor to persistent wage gaps.</p>
<p>EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at www.eeoc.gov.
