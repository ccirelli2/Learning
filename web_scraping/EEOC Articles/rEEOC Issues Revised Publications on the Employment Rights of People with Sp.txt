<h1>EEOC Issues Revised Publications on the Employment Rights of People with Specific Disabilities</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON --The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today issued four revised documents on protection against disability discrimination, pursuant to the goal of the agency's Strategic Plan to provide up-to-date guidance on the
requirements of antidiscrimination laws.</p>
<p>The documents address how the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to applicants and employees with <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/cancer.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=173814,cancer.cfm,46|">cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/diabetes.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=173805,diabetes.cfm,46|">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/epilepsy.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=173818,epilepsy.cfm,46|">epilepsy</a>, and <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/intellectual_disabilities.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=173810,intellectual_disabilities.cfm,46|">intellectual disabilities</a>. These documents are available on the agency's website at "Disability Discrimination, The
Question and Answer Series," <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/disability.cfm">http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/disability.cfm</a>.</p>
<p>"Nearly 34 million Americans have been diagnosed with cancer, diabetes, or epilepsy, and more than 2 million have an intellectual disability," said EEOC Chair Jacqueline A. Berrien. "Many of them are looking for jobs or are already in the
workplace. While there is a considerable amount of general information available about the ADA, the EEOC often is asked questions about how the ADA applies to these conditions."</p>
<p>In plain, easy-to-understand language, the revised documents reflect the changes to the definition of disability made by the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) that make it easier to conclude that individuals with a wide range of impairments, including
cancer, diabetes, epilepsy, and intellectual disabilities, are protected by the ADA. Each of the documents also answers questions about topics such as: when an employer may obtain medical information from applicants and employees; what types of
reasonable accommodations individuals with these particular disabilities might need; how an employer should handle safety concerns; and what an employer should do to prevent and correct disability-based harassment.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
