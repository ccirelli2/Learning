<h1>EEOC Issues Publication on the Rights of Job Applicants and Employees with Mental Health Conditions</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today issued a resource document that explains workplace rights for individuals with mental health conditions under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/mental_health.cfm">Depression, PTSD, &amp; Other Mental Health Conditions in the Workplace: Your Legal Rights</a> explains that job applicants and employees with mental health conditions are
protected from employment discrimination and harassment based on their conditions. They may also have a right to reasonable accommodations at work. Reasonable accommodations are work adjustments that can help individuals to perform their jobs and
remain employed. The resource document also answers questions about how to get an accommodation, describes some types of accommodations, and addresses restrictions on employer access to medical information, confidentiality, and the role of the EEOC
in enforcing the rights of people with disabilities.</p>
<p>EEOC charge data shows that charges of discrimination based on mental health conditions are on the rise. During fiscal year 2016, preliminary data shows that EEOC resolved almost 5,000 charges of discrimination based on mental health conditions,
obtaining approximately $20 million for individuals with mental health conditions who were unlawfully denied employment and reasonable accommodations.</p>
<p>"Many people with common mental health conditions have important protections under the ADA," said EEOC Chair Jenny R. Yang. "Employers, job applicants, and employees should know that mental health conditions are no different than physical health
conditions under the law. In our recent outreach to veterans who have returned home with service-connected disabilities, we have seen the need to raise awareness about these issues. This resource document aims to clarify the protections that the ADA
affords employees."</p>
<p>The resource document is part of an ongoing series of publications providing individuals with medical conditions or work restrictions with user-friendly explanations of their rights, and with information that they can give to a health care
provider to explain how to provide appropriate medical documentation, if required. Earlier this year EEOC published resource documents addressing the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/hiv_individual.cfm">employment rights of
individuals with HIV infection</a> and <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/pregnant_workers.cfm">individuals who are pregnant</a>. The new publication's companion document, The Mental Health Provider's Role in a Client's Request for a
Reasonable Accommodation at Work, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/ada_mental_health_provider.cfm">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.
