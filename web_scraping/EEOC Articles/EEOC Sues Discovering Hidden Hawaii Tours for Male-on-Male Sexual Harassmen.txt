<h1>EEOC Sues Discovering Hidden Hawaii Tours for Male-on-Male Sexual Harassment</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Company President</em></strong><strong><em>Sexually Harassed Male Employees for More Than a Decade, </em></strong><strong style="font-size: 12.16px;"><em>Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>HONOLULU, Hawaii - Three related Hawaii tour companies -- Discovering Hidden Hawaii Tours, Inc., Hawaii Tours and Transporta­tion, Inc. and Big Kahuna Luau, Inc. -- violated federal anti-discrim­ination laws by allowing the ongoing sexual
harassment of male employees, the U.S. Equal Employ­ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's lawsuit, the president of Discovering Hidden Hawaii Tours engaged in a pattern of sexually harassing young males after recruiting them to work for his companies. The harass­ment, which spanned more than a decade, included
inviting males to join in sex parties with him; show­ing them pornographic videos and photos; requiring them to show him their private parts in order to be considered for employment; making employment opportunities contingent upon engaging in sexual
acts with him; and performing unwanted sexual acts on male employees.</p>
<p>The EEOC further contends that when employees complained about the harassment, the company failed to take corrective action. Some male employees felt that they had no other recourse but to quit. In some instances, the president retaliated against
male employees after they complained about the harassment to their supervisors, according to the suit.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed its suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii (EEOC v. Discovering Hidden Hawaii Tours, Inc., Case No: 1:17-cv-00067) after first attempting to
reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The agency's suit seeks back pay, along with compensatory and punitive damages for a class of individuals, as well as injunctive relief intended to prevent any future discrimination
and harassment in the workplace.</p>
<p>"All employees, regardless of gender, have the right to work in a harassment-free workplace and should never be forced to endure such abuse," said Anna Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles District, which includes Hawaii in its
jurisdiction. "I applaud these young men for coming forward to tell their stories."</p>
<p>Glory Gervacio Saure, director of the EEOC's Honolulu Local Office, added, "Harassment is alleged in 31% of all charges filed with the EEOC. When employers fail to address workplace harass­ment, employees often feel that they must choose between
putting up with the abuse or quitting. No one should have to make that choice."</p>
<p>According to the company's website, www.discoverhiddenhawaiitours.com, Discovering Hidden Hawaii Tours provides guided tours of Oahu, Maui, the Big Island, and Kauai.</p>
<p>Individuals who may have experienced sexual harassment or have information pertaining to sexual harassment in connection with employment at Discovering Hidden Hawaii Tours should contact the EEOC at 808-541-3133 for more information.</p>
<p>Preventing workplace harassment through systemic litigation and investigation is one of the six national priorities identified by the Commission's Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP).</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the latest EEOC news by
