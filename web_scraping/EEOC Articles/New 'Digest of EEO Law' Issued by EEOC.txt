</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Includes Key Federal Sector Decisions, Special Article on Discrimination </em></strong><strong style="font-size: 12.16px;"><em>Due to Mental Health Conditions Under EEO Laws</em></strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today announced the latest edition of its federal sector <em>Digest of Equal Employment Opportunity Law (EEO Digest)</em>, which is available <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/federal/digest/vol_4_fy2016.cfm">online</a>.</p>
<p>This edition (Fiscal Year 2016, Volume 4) features a special article entitled <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/federal/digest/vol_4_fy2016.cfm#article"><em>Discrimination on the Basis of Mental Health Conditions Under the ADA and Rehabilitation
Act</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>"Unlike physical disabilities, which are often recognizable, mental health impairments are often hidden," said Carlton M. Hadden, director of EEOC's Office of Federal Operations (OFO). "Federal agencies should be mindful of the unique needs and
obstacles that employees with mental health conditions face in the workplace."</p>
<p>The <em>EEO Digest</em>, a quarterly publication prepared by OFO, features a wide variety of recent Commission decisions and federal court cases of interest. The <em>Digest</em> also includes hyperlinks so that stakeholders can easily access the
full decisions which have been summarized. </p>
<p>This edition of the <em>Digest</em> contains summaries of noteworthy decisions issued by EEOC, including cases involving: Agency Processing, Attorneys' Fees, Class Complaints, Compensatory Damages, Dismissals, Findings of the Merits, Remedies,
Settlement Agreements, Stating a Claim, Summary Judgment, and Timeliness. </p>
<p>The summaries are neither intended to be exhaustive or definitive as to the selected subject matter, nor are they to be given the legal weight of case law in citations. In addition to the quarterly <em>Digest</em>, Commission federal sector
decisions are available on EEOC's <a href="http://eeoc.gov/federal/decisions.cfm">website</a>.</p>
<p>The public may also receive federal sector information updates and news items via <a href="https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEEOC/subscriber/new">GovDelivery</a> and also via <a href="mailto:@EEOC_OFO">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination in the public and private sectors. Further information about EEOC is available online at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
