<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will enter into a national Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Ecuador on Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time), at EEOC headquarters, 131 M Street,
N.E., Washington, D.C., 20507.</p>
<p>The agreement will establish an ongoing collaborative relationship between EEOC and Ecuadorian embassy and consulates nationwide to provide Ecuadorian nationals with information, guidance, and access to education and training resources to help
them exercise their workplace rights. This agreement addresses a key objective of EEOC's Strategic Enforcement Plan: to protect the rights of immigrants, migrants, and other vulnerable workers. EEOC Chair Jenny Yang and Ecuadorian Ambassador
Francisco Borja Cevallos will sign the agreement.</p>
<p>Seating is limited, and EEOC encourages visitors to arrive 30 minutes before the meeting to be processed through security and escorted to the meeting room. Visitors should bring a government-issued photo identification card to facilitate entry
into the building.</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further infor­mation about the EEOC is available on its website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
