and Cincinnati, the federal agency announced today.</p>
<p>A 1985 graduate of Indiana University School of Law in Bloomington, Eisele began her legal career working for Stephen Goldsmith at the Marion County Prosecutor's Office in Indianapolis and joined EEOC as a trial attorney in 1987. In 1998, she
became the supervisory trial attorney of the Indianapolis District Office. She has litigated or supervised many cases during her time with EEOC, recovering millions of dollars for victims of discrimination and obtaining changes to employers'
policies and practices to prevent future discriminatory treatment. She has been a frequent speaker regarding EEOC and employment discrimination and has trained EEOC investigators regarding investigative writing, negotiations, systemic discrimination
and other issues. She currently serves as the president of the National Employment Lawyers Association's (NELA) Indiana affiliate and is a member of the Employment, Labor &amp; Benefits Law Section Council of the Indiana State Bar Association.</p>
<p>"Ms. Eisele's proven track record and her strong relationships with the plaintiff's bar and non-profit advocacy groups demonstrate her commitment to fighting employment discrimination," said EEOC General Counsel David Lopez. "She has the
experience and drive to build upon the district's successful litigation program, which includes cutting-edge litigation that advances the development of the law."</p>
<p>Eisele said, "I am honored to be selected and look forward to leading the district's attorneys and legal unit staff in the ongoing battle against employment discrimination."</p>
