<h1>EEOC Baltimore Field Office and Consular Section of the Mexican Embassy Sign Historic Outreach Agreement</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Pact Establishes Ongoing Collaborative Relationship to Fight Discrimination</em></strong></p>
<p>BALTIMORE -- The Baltimore Field Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a memorandum of understanding with the consular section of the Embassy of the United Mexican States in Baltimore today. The agreement
establishes an ongoing collaboration to provide Mexican nationals in Maryland with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace regardless of immigration status.</p>
<p>Juan Carlos Mendoza Sánchez, head of the consular section, and EEOC Baltimore Field Office Director Rosemarie Rhodes signed the agreement. The Baltimore Field Office is part of EEOC's Philadelphia District.</p>
<p>"By signing this memorandum of understanding today, we solidify our commitment to provide education, outreach and service to the Mexican community in Maryland," said Rhodes. "We look forward to working with the consular section to promote equal
opportunity and workplace justice for all workers."</p>
<p>Under its terms, EEOC and the embassy's consular section will work together to provide information regarding workplace discrimination and harassment to workers in Maryland. They will distribute Spanish-language materials explaining the laws
enforced by EEOC to workers. They will provide representatives to meet with Mexican nationals in Maryland in order to provide training and counseling regarding employment discrimination matters. EEOC will also conduct training to consular section
staff about EEOC and the laws it enforces.</p>
<p>Eliminating discriminatory policies affecting vulnerable workers who may be unaware of their rights under equal employment laws, or reluctant or unable to exercise them, is one of six national priorities identified by EEOC's Strategic Enforcement
Plan. These policies can include disparate pay, job segregation, harassment, and trafficking.</p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment. EEOC's Philadelphia District Office has jurisdiction over Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia and parts of New Jersey and Ohio.</p>
