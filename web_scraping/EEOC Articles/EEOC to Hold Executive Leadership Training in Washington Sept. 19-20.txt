<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will hold its Executive Leadership Training Conference (ELC) on Sept. 19-20 at the Washington Renaissance Hotel in Washington, the federal agency announced today.</p>
<p>This year's ELC theme is: <strong><em>Leadership Through Times of Transition: Flexibility Meets Precision</em></strong>.  Leaders who are flexible and able to adapt to change are successful during any presidential transition process and
change of administration. The ELC training provides participants with skills to successfully navigate change and prepare for the new incoming presidential administration in January 2017. Registration and exhibitor information is available <a href="http://eeocleadershipconference.com/default.asp">online</a>.</p>
<p>The ELC meets the professional development needs of senior leaders in the field of equal employment opportunity (EEO) and diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I). Training will address key leadership competencies during times of transition; personal
development and critically important topics vital to the success of current and future executives - particularly senior EEO officials for federal, state and local governments; private sector EEO executives; HR executives with responsibility for
managing and implementing an EEO program; as well as those striving to attain senior-level positions.</p>
<p>"ELC is a cost-effective and modest investment in the executive leadership skills necessary to run a successful EEO program," said Carlton M. Hadden, director of EEOC's Office of Federal Operations. "This training will directly address core
leadership competencies, ensuring that EEO professionals have the executive training necessary to meet the challenges of our profession."</p>
