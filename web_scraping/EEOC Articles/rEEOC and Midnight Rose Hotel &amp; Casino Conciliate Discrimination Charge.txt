<h1>EEOC and Midnight Rose Hotel &amp; Casino Conciliate Discrimination Charge</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>DENVER - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Midnight Rose Hotel &amp; Casino in Cripple Creek, Colo., have agreed to resolve a disability discrimination charge filed by a former employee, the federal agency announced
today.</p>
<p>The charge contained allegations that the employee was denied a reasonable accommodation and discharged due to her disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the charge, EEOC conducted an investigation and determined that a violation of the ADA occurred. The company denies any wrongdoing or liability and maintains that its conduct arose from its efforts to comply with gaming
regulations. The company cooperated fully with the EEOC investigation, and has agreed to a financial settlement to the charging party.</p>
<p>The company has also agreed to conduct additional training to its staff on laws covered by the ADA.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces the federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov.</p></div>
