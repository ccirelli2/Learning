collaborative relationship between these two entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace. Mexican Consul General Juan Carlos Mendoza Sánchez and

<p>The Mexican Consulate in Washington, D.C. provides services to preserve the rights of Mexican nationals. The EEOC's Richmond Local Office enforces federal employment discrimination laws, and is part of the EEOC Charlotte District.</p>
<p>"The EEOC is committed to our mission to stop and remedy unlawful employment discrimination in every facet of employment, and this agreement allows us the unique opportunity to collaborate with the consulate to ensure that we provide outreach and
education to individuals who may have difficulty accessing our services," said Richmond Local Office Director Daron L. Calhoun. "We look forward to working with the Mexican consulate in this collaborative relationship and partnership to promote
justice and equality in the workplace."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the Richmond Local Office will work with the Mexican consulate to collaborate on education and outreach efforts to ensure that Mexican nationals are aware of applicable workplace laws and
regulations, and a system for referring complaints to the EEOC.</p>
