<h1>EEOC Sues Halliburton For  Breach of Mediation Agreement</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Company Failed to Honor Agreement to Hire Applicant to Resolve Disability Discrimination Charge, Federal Agency Says</em></strong></p>
<p>JACKSON, Miss. - Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. and Boots &amp; Coots, LLC, an oil and gas exploration services company with headquarters in Houston, violated federal law by failing to comply with obligations imposed by a mediated settlement
agreement of an employment discrimination charge, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed on March 31.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's suit, Halliburton entered into a mediation settlement agreement with EEOC and the applicant on Feb. 4, 2014, resolving a disability discrimination charge against the company. Among other relief provided, Halliburton promised
to rehire the applicant into a position subject to successful employment screening. Despite the applicant's compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement, Halliburton has since failed to hire him for any position. EEOC contends that
Halliburton's actions constitute breach of the settlement agreement. Further, such alleged conduct violates Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).</p>
<p>EEOC's suit (<em>EEOC v. Halliburton Energy Service, Inc. and Boots &amp; Coots, LLC d/b/a/ Boots and Coots Services</em>, Civil Action No. 3:16-cv-00233-CWR-FKB, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi) seeks
monetary relief in the form of back pay plus interest, compensatory damages, and an injunction against future discrimination.</p>
<p>"Typically, court intervention is not necessary when parties reach a voluntary agreement," said EEOC Birmingham Regional Attorney, C. Emanuel Smith. "This litigation follows numerous efforts at voluntary compliance."</p>
<p>EEOC Jackson Area Office Director Wilma Scott added, "When an employer refuses to honor the promises it made in a voluntary settlement agreement, EEOC will take action to enforce that agreement."</p>
<p>According to company information, Halliburton owns hundreds of subsidiaries, affiliates, branches, brands and divisions throughout the United States and worldwide, employing approximately 70,000 people. Halliburton provides oil and gas
exploration services and related services, both onshore and offshore. Additionally, Halliburton provides oil and hazardous material spill containment resulting from oil well fire emergencies, and provides restoration services to return oil and gas
wells to production.</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its website at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
