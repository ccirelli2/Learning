<p>INDIANAPOLIS – WBS Broad Ripple, Inc., doing business as the Wild Beaver Saloon in Indianapolis, unlawfully fired a female bartender/server because of her pregnancy, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed March 16, 2011.</p>
<p>The suit, <em>EEOC v. WBS Broad Ripple, Inc., d/b/a Wild Beaver Saloon</em>, Civil Action No. 1:11-cv-00373-TWP-DML, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division, charged that the company violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, including pregnancy.</p>
<p>“Employees who become pregnant should not lose their jobs because of their condition,” said Laurie A. Young, regional attorney of the Indianapolis District Office. “The Commission will vigorously prosecute employers who engage in pregnancy discrimination or other forms of sex discrimination.”</p>
<p>The EEOC is seeking compensatory and punitive damages against the company, as well as other relief, including a permanent injunction to prevent the company from engaging in any employment practice that discriminates on the bases of sex.</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
