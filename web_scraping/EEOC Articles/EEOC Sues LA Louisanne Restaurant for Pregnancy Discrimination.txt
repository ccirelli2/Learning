<h1>EEOC Sues LA Louisanne Restaurant for Pregnancy Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Restaurant Engaged in a Practice of Removing Pregnant Female Servers, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>LOS ANGELES - LA Louisanne, Inc., a Los Angeles restaurant and jazz night club, violated federal law when it discharged an employee because of her pregnancy, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a pregnancy
discrimination lawsuit filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's lawsuit, the restaurant cut a pregnant server's hours after she announced she was pregnant and refused to let her return to work after she gave birth. The EEOC also believes that other employees have been subject to
discrimination because of their pregnancies.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (EEOC v. LA Louisanne, Inc., Case No.
2:17-cv-06690) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The EEOC's suit seeks back pay, compensatory and punitive damages for the female employee and a class of similarly affected employees, as
well as injunctive relief intended to prevent further discrimination at the business.</p>
<p>"Pregnancy discrimination continues to be a persistent problem, even though it has been against federal law for nearly 40 years," said Anna Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles District. "Employers should be cognizant of their
obligations under the law to maintain a workplace free of discrimination against employees who are expectant mothers."</p>
<p>Christopher Green, director of the EEOC's San Diego local office which investigated the charge, added, "Women should not have to choose between their job or having children. Employers need to be aware that the EEOC takes pregnancy discrimination
seriously and the agency will continue to protect the rights of pregnant employees."</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the latest EEOC news by
