<h1>Next Commission Meeting Wednesday, March 20</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will hold a meeting on Wednesday, March 20, at 9:50 a.m. (Eastern Time), at agency headquarters, 131 M Street, N.E. In accordance with the Sunshine Act, the open session of the
meeting will be open to public observation of the Commission's deliberations and voting.  The meeting will address the development of the agency's Quality Control Plan (QCP) for investigations and conciliations.  For scheduling purposes,
the meeting is anticipated to conclude at 4:00 p.m, with an hour break taken around 1:00 p.m.  </p>
<p>The EEOC's 2012-2016 Strategic Plan establishes a framework for achieving the EEOC's mission to stop and remedy unlawful employment discrimination by focusing on strategic law enforcement, education and outreach and efficiently serving the
public.  The second performance measure of the plan requires the EEOC to approve a QCP, which is currently being developed.</p>
<p>QCP is intended to revise the criteria used to measure the quality of agency investigations and conciliations throughout the nation.  To develop a draft of the plan for Commission consideration, Chair Jacqueline Berrien appointed an internal
work group chaired by Commissioner Chai Feldblum, Chicago District Director John Rowe, and Dallas District Director Janet Elizondo.  The work group is reviewing the current status of EEOC investigations and conciliations to look for areas where
the agency is excelling in its administrative law enforcement program and where the agency would benefit from improvements within the context of the agency's limited fiscal resources. </p>
<p>To ensure the views of agency staff and external stakeholders are incorporated into the development process, the Commission solicited written public input in February 2012 and is now holding a public meeting featuring three moderated roundtable
conversations with EEOC staff and private practitioners.  Participants will address EEOC investigations and conciliations and offer their recommendations for indicia to measure their quality. </p>
<p>As part of our efforts to comply with the President's sequestration order, panelists will participate via video teleconference (VTC) from an EEOC office, telephone, or in person at their own expense.  The following persons are confirmed to
