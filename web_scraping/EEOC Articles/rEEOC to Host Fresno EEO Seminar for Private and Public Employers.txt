<p>FRESNO, Calif. - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency charged with enforcing laws against employment discrimination, announced the EEOC Fresno Technical Assistance Program Seminar (TAPS) will take place on
Sept. 10 in Fresno, Calif.</p>
<p>This year's seminar-aimed at both private and public employer representatives--will feature keynote presentations by EEOC's senior management officials, including Rosa Viramontes, district director, and Anna Park, regional attorney from the Los
Angeles District, which includes Fresno in its jurisdiction. An official from the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage &amp; Hour Division is also slated to present.</p>
<p>The seminar is geared toward attorneys, mediators, human resource and equal employment<br/>
opportunity (EEO) professionals in the private and public sectors, along with other interested parties.<br/>
The comprehensive training sessions will provide updates and guidance on EEO law and how to approach EEO cases the way EEOC experts do.  Workshop topics include addressing complaints at work and in cyberspace; discrimination against lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender employees; ADA-compliant reasonable accommodations and pregnancy issues; and navigating cultural and religious tensions in the workplace.</p>
<p>"We look forward to connecting with local employer representatives in Fresno," said<br/>
Viramontes.  "Our seminar is an opportunity to hear firsthand from EEOC officials who will provide<br/>
updates and guidance on how to address and prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation in the<br/>
workplace."</p>
