<h1>EEOC Sues Warren Tricomi for Pregnancy Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><em><strong>Hair Salon Withdrew Promotion and Fired Employee After Learning of Pregnancy, Federal Agency Charges</strong></em></p>
<p>NEW YORK – Warren Tricomi, a New York-based hair salon with locations in the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan and in Greenwich, Conn., violated federal anti-discrimination law when it withdrew an offer for a promotion and fired an assistant colorist when it found out she was pregnant, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, an assistant colorist in the New York salon was offered a promotion to colorist at Warren Tricomi’s Greenwich, Conn., location.  On approximately August 23, 2010, the woman informed Joel Warren, a Warren Tricomi owner, that she was pregnant. He told her that the information was a lot to digest and he would have to discuss it with the other owners.  After several failed attempts to get in touch with Warren about her start date in the new position, Warren Tricomi fired the employee around September 1, 2010. <br/>
</p>
<p>This alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.  The EEOC filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Civil Action No.: 11 civ 6837) after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement out of court.</p>
<p>“Federal law protects women from discrimination based on pregnancy,” said Elizabeth Grossman, Regional Attorney of the EEOC New York District Office. “Employers have a duty to respect the ability of pregnant women to participate in the workforce, and the EEOC is committed to enforcing the law when employers fall short of this duty.”</p>
<p>Ana Martinez, trial attorney in the New York District Office, added, “A woman’s pregnancy should not affect her ability to be promoted in the workplace. Warren Tricomi was ready to promote this woman based on her qualifications, but decided it would fire her instead after finding out she was pregnant.  The EEOC will continue to fight against such unlawful discrimination.” <br/>
</p>
<p>The EEOC’s New York District Office has jurisdiction over Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and portions of New Jersey.</p>
<p>The EEOC is the government agency responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment.  Further information about the EEOC is available at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
