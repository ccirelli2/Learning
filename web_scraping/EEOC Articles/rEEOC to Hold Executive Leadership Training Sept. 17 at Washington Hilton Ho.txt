<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will hold its third annual executive leadership conference (ELC) on Wednesday, Sept. 17 at the Washington Hilton Hotel, the agency announced today. Registration and exhibitor
information for the one-day event is available online at <a href="http://www.eeocleadershipconference.com/" id="http://www.eeocleadershipconference.com/|">http://www.eeocleadershipconference.com/</a>. </p>
<p>The ELC is designed to meet the professional development needs of senior leaders in the field of equal employment opportunity (EEO). Training will address key leadership competencies, personal development, and other critically important topics
vital to the success of current and future executives.  This training will be particularly advantageous for senior EEO officials for federal, state and local governments; private-sector EEO executives; HR executives with responsibility for
managing and implementing an EEO program; as well as those striving to attain senior-level positions. </p>
<p>"ELC is a cost-effective and modest investment in the executive leadership skills necessary to run a successful EEO program," said Carlton Hadden, director of the EEOC's Office of Federal Operations (OFO).  "This training will directly
address core leadership competencies, ensuring that EEO professionals have the executive training necessary to meet the challenges of our profession."</p>
<p>The ELC will feature remarks from Aneesh Chopra, who was appointed by President Obama in 2009 as the U.S. government's first-ever chief technology officer.  Mr. Chopra is also author of <em>Innovative State: How New Technologies Can
Transform Government</em>.</p>
<p>Other presenters include officials from the Federal Executive Institute and the National Science Foundation.  Registration is limited to the GS-14 level and above, as well as private-sector equivalents.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination.  Further information about the agency is available at www.eeoc.gov.</p></div>
