<h1>Scottsdale Car Dealership Sued by EEOC for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Bell Lexus and The Berge Group Rescinded Job Offer Based on </em></strong><strong style="font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 1.6em;"><em>Woman's Lawful Prescription Drug Use, Federal Agency
Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>PHOENIX - A Scottsdale, Ariz., car dealership company violated federal law by rescinding a job offer after a pre-employment drug test revealed a prescription drug used to treat a disability, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
charged in a lawsuit it filed today.</p>
<p>According to EEOC's lawsuit, Bell-Arrow Automotive, Inc. (doing business as Bell Lexus), a subsidiary of Bell Leasing, Inc. (doing business as The Berge Group), maintained a policy of refusing to employ any applicant who tested positive for one
of several enumerated substances on a list identi­fied by Bell Lexus and the Berge Group. Bell Lexus extended a job offer to Sara Thorholm to work as product specialist or a salesperson, but rescinded it when her drug test returned positive for a
single substance. Thorholm explained to Bell Lexus that the substance was legally prescribed to treat a disability and would not affect her ability to perform the duties of the job. Bell Lexus refused both Thorholm's offer of proof and her offer to
change medications.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits employers from making employment decisions based on an individual's disability or need for reasonable accommoda­tion, and to make such accommodations absent undue
hardship. EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona (<em>EEOC v. Bell Leasing, Inc.</em>, Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-02848-DKD) after first attempt­ing to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The
lawsuit seeks monetary damages, including back pay, compensation for emotional distress, and punitive damages. EEOC also seeks injunctive relief, including training on the ADA, and other relief to prevent further discriminatory practices.</p>
<p>"Even when drug tests are permitted under the ADA, they cannot be used to discriminate against qualified people with disabilities," said EEOC Phoenix Regional Attorney Mary Jo O'Neill. "Com­panies need to be mindful that they may need to make
exceptions to drug use policies as a reasonable accom­modation."</p>
<p>EEOC Phoenix Acting District Director Elizabeth Cadle added, "Employers must maintain responsible hiring practices and be understanding about their employees' backgrounds. A blanket exclusion policy based on drug use does not accomplish that
goal, and may cause problems for the employer if it applies such a policy."</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. EEOC's Phoenix District Office has jurisdiction for Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and part of New Mexico (including Albuquerque). Further information about EEOC is available on
its website at www.eeoc.gov. </p></div>
