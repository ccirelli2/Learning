<h1>EEOC Sues Dodge’s Chicken Store for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Federal Agency Charges Hot Springs Store Refused to Provide Reasonable Accommodation for Manager’s Seizure Disorder</em></strong></p>
<p>HOT SPRINGS, Ark. – Savings Station Dodge Stores, doing business as Dodge’s Chicken Store #631 in Hot Springs, violated federal law by refusing to provide a reasonable accommodation for a manager who had a driving restriction as the result of her disability, and then firing her, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed September 28, 2010.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, the store manager, who had worked for Dodge’s since 2004, developed a disability, a seizure disorder, which prevented her from driving. The EEOC said that the manager twice proposed a reasonable accommodation that involved the reassignment of a daily competitor gas price survey duty that required driving.  The manager asked that the duty be completed by a co-worker or that she be allowed to use alternative means to complete the survey such as phone or Internet in lieu of driving. However, Dodge’s offered only a demotion to a hostess position. When the manager rejected that offer, which would have resulted in a significant pay cut, she was terminated, the EEOC said.</p>
<p>Denial of a reasonable accommodation to a disabled individual violates Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 6:10-cv-06072 in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, Hot Springs Division) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement. The lawsuit asks the court to, among other things, grant a permanent injunction enjoining Dodge’s Chicken Store from denying reasonable accommodations to disabled individuals in the future and for lost wages, as well as other out-of-pocket expenses, compensatory and punitive damages to the discrimination victim.</p>
<p>“Reasonable accommodations allow many individuals with disabilities to work,” said Katharine W. Kores, the EEOC’s director for the Memphis District Office. “Employers should understand that ignoring an employee’s request for a reasonable accommodation and discharging her because of her disability is a violation of federal law. The EEOC is committed to its responsibility to enforce the ADA and the ADA Amendments Act.”</p>
<p>Dodge’s Chicken Store #631 is one of several convenience stores and gas retailers that are operated in Arkansas and Mississippi by the D&amp;H Company of Tupelo, Miss.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
