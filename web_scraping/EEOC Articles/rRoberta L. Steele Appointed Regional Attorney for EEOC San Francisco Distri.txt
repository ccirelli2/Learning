<div align="left"><p>SAN FRANCISCO - Roberta L. Steele has been appointed as Regional Attorney for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) San Francisco District Office effective Nov. 2, 2015. Throughout her legal career, Steele has worked exclusively as a
plaintiffs' attorney, with a significant practice in the area of employment discrimination law. For 17 years, Steele worked with a plaintiffs' firm in Oakland, California, focusing on investigating and litigating class and collective actions under
federal and state employment discrimination laws, as well as other statutes such as the wage and hour and environmental laws. Since December 2013, Steele has been the Program Director at the National Employment Lawyers Association (NELA) where she
is responsible for the coordination of NELA's amicus, judicial nominations and continuing legal education programs, and public policy work.</p>
<p>"EEOC is fortunate to have been able to hire someone of Roberta's background and experience as the head of our litigation program in the San Francisco District Office," said EEOC General Counsel P. David Lopez. "Her broad and deep experience
litigating civil rights cases throughout the nation, particularly systemic matters, will be invaluable to the agency."</p>
<p>Steele said, "I am honored and excited to have the opportunity to serve as a Regional Attorney for the EEOC. My entire legal career has focused on protecting workers' rights. This position will permit me to perform the important work of enforcing
the anti-discrimination laws for employees on behalf of the federal government."</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
