<p>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today announced the release of a <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/federal/directives/personal-assistance-services.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=219437,personal-assistance-services.cfm,29|">Questions and Answers Guide</a> to assist federal agencies to provide personal assistance services (PAS) under Section 501 the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is available
on the EEOC's website<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>In January 2017, the EEOC amended the regulations implementing Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, the law that prohibits the federal government from discriminating in employment based on disability and which requires it to engage in
affirmative action for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>The amended regulations require the provision of PAS to individuals who need them because of certain disabilities. These are services that help persons who because of those disabilities, require assistance to perform basic activities of daily
living. This document answers common questions about this provision of the revised regulations.</p>
<p>"This resource is designed to answer questions as federal agencies implement this provision," said Carlton M. Hadden, director of EEOC's Office of Federal Operations (OFO).</p>
