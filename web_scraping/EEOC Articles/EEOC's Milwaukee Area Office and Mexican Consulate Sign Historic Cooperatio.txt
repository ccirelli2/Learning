</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Offices Agree to Work Together to Fight Discrimination</em></strong></p>
<p>MILWAUKEE - The Milwaukee Area Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in Milwaukee this week with the Consulate of Mexico. The agreement establishes an ongoing
collaboration between these entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace regardless of immigration status. Mexican Consul Julián Adem Díaz de León and
Milwaukee Area Office Director Rosemary Fox signed the agreement.</p>
<p>"The signing of this MOU renews our collaborative relationship with the Mexican consulate to provide the opportunity for ongoing education, outreach and service by EEOC to Mexican nationals in our area," said Fox. "EEOC is committed to stopping
and remedying unlawful employment discrimination against immigrant, migrant and other vulnerable workers."</p>
<p>Each year during the last week of August and early September, these partners join forces with workers' rights groups, faith-based and community organizations and local unions, which either host or help, sponsor informa­tional workshops,
educational sessions and other special events. </p>
<p>Labor Rights Week is a collaborative effort between embassies, their consulates and government agencies' district offices to increase awareness and inform workers and employers about their rights and responsibilities under U.S. labor laws. This
MOU exemplifies the overall intent of EEOC and the Mexican consulate to continue the efforts to assist the community.</p>
<p>EEOC's Milwaukee Area Office is responsible for processing discrimination charges, adminis­trative enforcement and the conduct of agency litigation in Wisconsin and Iowa.</p>
<p>EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
