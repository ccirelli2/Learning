<p>JACKSON, Miss. – On Wednesday, May 18, 2011, the Jackson Area Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Jackson State University College of Business will co-host a Fair Pay Seminar to discuss the wage gap between men and women. The event will be held at the JSU College of Business, 1400 J.R. Lynch Street, Room 119 from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m.  It is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The theme of the seminar, “An Honest Day’s Work for An Honest Day’s Pay--Regardless of Gender,” focuses on the fact that 50 years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the wage gap between men and women still persists.  Women are paid an average of only 77cents for every dollar earned by men.  The gap is even greater for women of color and women with disabilities.</p>
<p>Lilly Ledbetter, for whom the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is named, will provide a “Personal Perspective” on wage discrimination.  Ms. Ledbetter is an Alabama native who was employed almost 20 years as a supervisor with Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. in Gadsden, Alabama. Ms. Ledbetter said, “I was paid less than male co-workers even though I was doing the same work and doing it well.”  Ms. Ledbetter did not learn of the wage difference until she received an anonymous note and she “had to stand up.”  Ms. Ledbetter will also discuss the long-term impact of discriminatory wages on her Social Security annuity and company pension benefits.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available at its web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
