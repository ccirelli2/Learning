<h1>Ultracare Las Vegas Settles  EEOC Sex Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Placement Agency Fired Male Employee Because Of His Gender, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>LAS VEGAS - Ultracare Las Vegas, an ultrasound technician provider, will pay $15,000 and furnish other relief to settle a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, from 2010 to 2013, Nevada Health Centers and Ultracare Las Vegas had a service contract whereby Ultracare agreed to provide Nevada Health Centers with ultrasound technicians. In November 2012, Ultracare hired David
Matlock as an ultrasound technician and placed him at Nevada Health Centers. Within weeks of his placement, Nevada Health Centers asked Ultracare to remove Matlock from the assignment. Ultracare promptly accommodated Nevada Health Center's request,
terminating Matlock's work assignment during the first week of January 2013.</p>
<p>The EEOC filed suit in June 2016, charging that Nevada Health Centers and Ultracare terminated David Matlock because of his gender, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [<em>EEOC v. Nevada Health Centers, Inc, Ultracare Las
Vegas</em>, Case No. 2:16-cv-01495-JAD-PAL]. Ultracare agreed to enter into a settlement with the EEOC. The lawsuit against Nevada Health Centers is still in litigation.</p>
<p>In addition to monetary relief, Ultracare will implement injunctive relief focused on ensuring equal employment opportunities for its employees, regardless of gender. Ultracare agreed to train its management on the importance of
non-discrimination in the recruitment, hiring, placement, and discharge of its employees. Ultracare also agreed to report any gender discrimination complaints and to provide reports on its recruitment, hiring, and placement practices.</p>
<p>"Sex-role stereotypes deprive qualified individuals from equal employment opportunities," said Anna Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles District Office, which includes Las Vegas in its jurisdiction. "Customer preference is not a
defense for discrimination. Placement companies must comply with the law even when a client openly expresses an illegal gender preference."</p>
<p>Christine Park-Gonzalez, acting local director of the EEOC's Las Vegas Local Office, added, "Employees should not have to worry whether their gender will be an obstacle to obtaining or maintaining employment. The EEOC remains committed to
ensuring that employees are entitled to equal employment opportunities, regardless of sex."</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the
