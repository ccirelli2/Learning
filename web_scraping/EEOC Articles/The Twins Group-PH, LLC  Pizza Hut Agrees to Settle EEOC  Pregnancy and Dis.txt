<h1>The Twins Group-PH, LLC / Pizza Hut Agrees to Settle EEOC  Pregnancy and Disability Claims</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. – The owner/operator of a Cincinnati-area Pizza Hut has agreed to settle a pregnancy and disability discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit against The Twins Group-PH, LLC d/b/a Pizza Hut, the company illegally inquired about an employee’s health status, shared her medical information with co-workers, reduced her hours due to her pregnancy, and discharged her because of pregnancy, in retaliation for her complaints of discrimination and because it regarded her as disabled due to a non-pregnancy related medical condition.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 10-514) in U.S. District Court for Southern District of Ohio, Cincinnati Division after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>The parties negotiated a consent decree which provides the employee with back pay and a neutral reference. It also provides for injunctive relief in the form of training and an agreement not to discriminate or retaliate further under Title VII and the ADA.</p>
<p>“Female employees should be free from termination or harassment because they are pregnant or have a perceived disability,” said Webster N. Smith, acting director of the EEOC’s Indianapolis District Office, which has jurisdiction for Southern Ohio. “Those who complain of discriminatory practices should not fear losing their jobs.”</p>

The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</div>
