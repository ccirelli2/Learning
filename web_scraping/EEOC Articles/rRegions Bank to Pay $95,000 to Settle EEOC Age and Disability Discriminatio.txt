<h1>Regions Bank to Pay $95,000 to Settle EEOC Age and Disability Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Bank Fired Branch Manager Because of Her Age and Disability, Agency Charged</strong></em></p>
<p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. - Regions Financial Corporation, doing business as Regions Bank, will pay $95,000 and provide injunctive relief to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the
agency announced today.  The EEOC had charged that Regions failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for a former employee's disability and discharged her because of her age.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's lawsuit, Regions refused a branch manager's request for reasonable accommodation - a demotion to a less stressful and demanding position because of a physical disability.  Subsequently, the EEOC said, Regions began
treating the 61-year old manager less favorably than younger managers and fired her because of her age.  The EEOC stated the branch manager had worked for Regions Bank's predecessor for more than 30 years and had worked for Regions Bank since
2005. </p>
<p>Denial of a reasonable accommodation to an otherwise qualified disabled individual violates Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, and discriminating on the basis of age violates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
(ADEA) of 1967.  The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 2:12-cv-02855) in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Western Division, after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation
process. </p>
<p>In the two-year consent decree agreed upon by the parties and approved by the court, Regions Bank will pay the former manager $95,000 in monetary damages; provide age and disability discrimination training for senior management and human resource
officials in western Tennessee; report complaints of discrimination that it receives to the EEOC; and post a notice to employees at its main Memphis branch and corporate office about the lawsuit that includes the EEOC's contact information.</p>
<p>"This resolution is another demonstration of the EEOC's commitment to eradicating age and disability discrimination in the workplace," said Faye A. Williams, regional attorney for the EEOC's Memphis District Office.  "The relief we obtained
in this case provides for the discrimination victim and puts measures in place to protect other Regions Bank employees in the future." </p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information is available at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
