<h1>EEOC Posts Webinar Recording On Wellness Program Rules</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Webinar Offered to Help Employers and Wellness Programs Comply with EEOC Rules</em></strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/events/webcast-wellness.cfm">posted online</a> a recording of its Oct. 19 webinar about the agency's 2016 rules on employer wellness
programs and federal law, the agency announced today.</p>
<p>On May 17, EEOC issued final rules that describe how Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) apply to wellness programs offered by employers that request health
information from employees and their family members. The rules allow limited incentives for employees and spouses to participate in such programs, but also include important privacy protections.</p>
<p>EEOC offered a webinar on Oct. 19 to discuss these rules. EEOC attorneys provided information that will help employers and wellness programs comply with the rules, including an overview of both rules and answers to frequently asked questions
the Commission has received since the rules were published. Also, a guest speaker from the U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration discussed the interaction between these EEOC final rules and certain provisions of Title
I of GINA and the Affordable Care Act applicable to employment-based group health plan coverage. This webinar is for human resource professionals, benefits attorneys and wellness program vendors.</p>
