<p>"I am honored and humbled to be chosen by President Trump to serve as Acting Chair of EEOC, the agency which safeguards the civil rights of American workers," Acting Chair Lipnic said. "I believe equal employment opportunity is critical to all
Americans and to how we define ourselves as a nation. I look forward to working with the President, my colleagues at EEOC, Congress, and, of course, the American people in this critical task."</p>
