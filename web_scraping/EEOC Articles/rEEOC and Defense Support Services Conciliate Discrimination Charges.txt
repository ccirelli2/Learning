<h1>EEOC and Defense Support Services Conciliate Discrimination Charges</h1>

<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Federal Agency Issues Reasonable Cause Finding on Retaliation Charge</strong></em></p>
<p>PHOENIX - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has found reasonable cause to believe discrimination occurred in charges filed by three female employees against an Arlington, Va.-based government defense contractor, the federal
agency announced today. </p>
<p>The three employees of the company's Fort Carson, Colo., facility filed their charges of sex discrimination, sexual harassment and retaliation for complaining about it with the EEOC's Denver Field Office and Phoenix District Office against
Defense Support Services LLC, a subsidiary of Pacific Architects and Engineers Incorporated.  These charges were investigated by the EEOC's Denver Field Office, and the EEOC issued reasonable-cause findings with respect to the allegation of
retaliation.</p>
<p>Defense Support Services denied wrongdoing and/or liability but agreed to conciliate all charges.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the conciliation agreement, the company will henceforth comply with all requirements under the Equal Pay Act of 1963.  The company also agreed to refrain from any discrimination or retaliation of any kind against
complaining parties or any person because of opposition to any practice declared unlawful under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; conduct equal employment opportunity training; and pay an unspecified monetary settlement to all parties.</p>
<p>"Discrimination by government contractors is particularly troubling," said Rayford O. Irvin, district director of the EEOC's Phoenix District Office.  "The EEOC is as committed today as it was 50 years ago - when it first opened its door -
to vigorously pursuing its mission to enforce all violations of federal anti-discrimination law."</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces the federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  The Phoenix District Office covers Utah, Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming, and part of New Mexico.  Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at
