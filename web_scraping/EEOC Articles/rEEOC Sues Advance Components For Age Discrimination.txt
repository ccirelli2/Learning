<h1>EEOC Sues Advance Components For Age Discrimination</h1>

<p>DALLAS  — The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today that  it has filed suit against Advance Components, Inc. for age discrimination,  complaining that the company unlawfully subjected a national sales  representative to age-based termination.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s lawsuit,  filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Civil Action  No. 3:11-cv-02115-B), Dan Miller, national sales representative for the company’s  central region, was terminated on Oct. 6, 2009 because of his age, 61. The company claims that the termination was a  result of the “economic downturn.” The  EEOC investigation revealed that a much younger employee with less experience  was given Miller’s territory.</p>
<p>Such  alleged conduct violates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The EEOC sued after first attempting to reach  a voluntary settlement. The agency seeks  injunctive relief including the formulation of policies to prevent and correct  age discrimination. The suit also seeks  lost wages and interest and other damages.</p>
<p>“The owner  of this company wanted to project a new, younger image,” said EEOC Senior Trial  Attorney William Backhaus. “He should  not have chosen to fire an older salesman hired by the company founder to  achieve whatever fleeting image he was seeking. Mr. Miller’s only fault was not staying  forever 30.”</p>
<p>The  EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is  available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
