<h1>EEOC's Systemic Program Shows Significant Success in Past 10 Years</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON - In a <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/systemic/review/">review of its systemic program</a> over the past 10 years, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) reports significant success in advancing workplace
opportunity by tackling systemic discrimination.</p>
<p>"EEOC has transformed its systemic program in the past decade by investing in staff, training, and technology to build systemic expertise in every EEOC district," reflected EEOC Chair Jenny R. Yang. These investments have produced a 250 percent
increase in systemic investigations in the past five years.  "As a direct result of EEOC's systemic work, more than 71,000 workers have received jobs and recovered lost wages, and many more have benefited from positive changes in workplace
practices," said Chair Yang.</p>
<p>Highlighting EEOC's significant achievements in resolving systemic cases, the review reports a 94% success rate in systemic lawsuits. In addition, EEOC tripled the amount of monetary relief recovered for victims in the past five fiscal years from
2011 through 2015, compared to the monetary relief recovered in the first five years after the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/task_reports/systemic.cfm">Systemic Task Force Report</a> of 2006.  EEOC also tripled the rate of successful
voluntary conciliations of systemic investigations from 21% in fiscal year 2007 to 64% in fiscal year 2015. </p>
<p>The review marks the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of EEOC's 2006 Systemic Task Force Report. The Task Force, led by former EEOC Commissioner Leslie E. Silverman, embarked on its work, as its report states, "with the recognition that the Commission
cannot effectively combat discrimination without a strong nationwide systemic program." </p>
<p>The review concludes with a preview of the agency's plans to build upon its systemic program to remove persistent and emerging barriers to opportunity. This includes developing solutions that align the interests of employees, employers, and EEOC
in fully utilizing the talents of all workers.</p>
<p>EEOC enforces the federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a></p></div>
