<h1>Statement of Samantha Elauf Following Oral Argument at the Supreme Court in EEOC v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores, Inc.</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON-- Samantha Elauf filed the original charge of religious discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that led to today's argument in the Supreme Court. She has the following statement for the press:</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma. When I applied for a position with Abercrombie Kids, I was a teenager who loved fashion.  I had worked in two other retail stores and was excited to work at the Abercrombie store.  No one had
ever told me that I could not wear a head scarf and sell clothing.  Then I learned I was not hired by Abercrombie because I wear a head scarf, which is a symbol of modesty in my Muslim faith.  This was shocking to me.  </p>
<p>I am grateful to the EEOC for looking into my complaint and taking this religious discrimination case to the courts.  I am not only standing up for myself, but for all people who wish to adhere to their faith while at work. Observance of my
faith should not prevent me from getting a job.<br/>
