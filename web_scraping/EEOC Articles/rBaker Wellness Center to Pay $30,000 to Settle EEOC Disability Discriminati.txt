<h1>Baker Wellness Center to Pay $30,000 to Settle EEOC Disability Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Baton Rouge-Area Adult Day Care Fired Employee Because of Diabetes, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS - Baker Wellness Center, Inc., a Baton Rouge-area adult day care and wellness center, will pay $30,000 and furnish other relief to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit filed last year by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, the EEOC charged that Baker Wellness violated federal law by firing a direct service worker because she had a disability, diabetes, and in retaliation against the worker for refusing to provide medical information which Baker
Wellness illegally requested on its application form.</p>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits employers from asking questions that elicit medical information at the pre-offer stage of employment. In addition, the ADA prohibits an employer from firing or taking other adverse employment
action against an employee for having a disability, requesting a reasonable accommodation, or complaining that she suffered or is suffering discrimination. The ADA also requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations where necessary on a
temporary or permanent basis.</p>
<p>After first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process, the EEOC filed the lawsuit (Civil Action No. 3:14-cv-00808) in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana.</p>
<p>On October 28, Judge Brian A. Jackson signed and entered a consent decree agreed to by the parties. In addition to the monetary settlement, the decree provides for significant non-monetary relief, including an injunction prohibiting any future
discrimination by Baker Wellness. The decree also requires the company to implement policies prohibiting disability discrimination; permanently modify its employment application to comply with the ADA, including by removing any pre-offer medical
inquiries; and post an anti-discrimination notice in the workplace. The decree also requires anti-discrimination training for managers and supervisors and periodic compliance reports by Baker Wellness to EEOC.</p>
<p>"At the pre-offer stage of employment, the ADA prohibits all disability-related inquiries and medical examinations," said Jim Sacher, EEOC's regional attorney for the Houston District. "Employers cannot justify asking disability-related questions
on an application by claiming the inquiries are related to the job."</p>
<p>Alexandra Navarre-Davis, one of the trial attorneys litigating the case on behalf of EEOC, added, "An employer may not discriminate on the basis of a disability or because of an employee's failure to disclose a disability. Further, once an
individual with a disability is hired, an employer must follow the ADA in responding to a reasonable accommodation request."</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC and the laws it enforces is available on the agency's web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov.</a></p></div>
