<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Health Care Consulting Firm Refused to Rehire Bilateral Amputee, Federal Agency Charged</strong></em></p>
<p>DETROIT-The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today that it has resolved its suit against J.A. Thomas &amp; Associates, a health care consulting firm, based in Atlanta, Ga.  In a settlement agreement filed with
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the company agreed to pay $350,000 in back pay and compensatory damages to a former employee who alleged that the company did not rehire her due to her disability.  In addition to the
monetary payment, J.A. Thomas agrees to provide training to all its employees on the Americans with Disabilities Act. </p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, Civil Action No. 2:11-cv-13347, J.A. Thomas violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) when it did not rehire the claimant, a bilateral amputee, as a health information management specialist after the company
decided to make the position remote. </p>
<p>"This is a favorable resolution for everyone," explained EEOC trial attorney Lauren Gibbs Burstein.  "J.A. Thomas's willingness to resolve this case without a trial is commendable." </p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
