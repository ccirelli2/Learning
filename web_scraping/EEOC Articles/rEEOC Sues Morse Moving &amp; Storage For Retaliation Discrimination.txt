<h1>EEOC Sues Morse Moving &amp; Storage For Retaliation Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Moving Company Fired an Employee For Complaining of Harassment, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>DETROIT - Morse Moving &amp; Storage, a residential and corporate moving services provider, violated federal law by firing an employee who complained of racial and sexual discrimination and harassment, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) alleged in a lawsuit filed today.</p>
<p>EEOC alleges Morse Moving &amp; Storage fired Latasha Black, who worked as a dispatcher, just hours after she complained about harassment.</p>
<p>Firing an employee in retaliation for complaining about racial or sexual discrimination violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan <em>(EEOC v. Morse Moving
&amp; Storage, Inc.</em>, Civil Case No.:2:15-CV-13442) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. EEOC seeks back pay, compensatory damages, punitive damages and injunctive relief-including a court
order prohibiting Morse from retaliating against employees in the future.</p>
<p>Retaliation is the most frequently alleged charge filed with EEOC. Preserving access to the legal system for individuals who want to exercise their rights under federal employment discrimination laws is a national priority for the federal
agency.</p>
<p>"Federal law protects employees who complain of workplace discrimination from being retaliated against," said Laurie A. Young, regional attorney for EEOC's Indianapolis District. "The EEOC will aggressively insure employees are free to exercise
their rights without fear of retaliation."</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
