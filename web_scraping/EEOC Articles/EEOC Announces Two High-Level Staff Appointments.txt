<h1>EEOC Announces Two High-Level Staff Appointments</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today the appointment of two career federal employees to key Senior Executive Service (SES) managerial positions at the agency. The SES is a federal government
personnel program in which civil service employees serve at various agencies at a level just below the top presidential appointees.</p>
<p>Carol R. Miaskoff has been selected as associate legal counsel, effective Oct. 29, and Samuel Christopher (Chris) Haffer has been selected as chief data officer and director of the Office of Research, Information and Planning, effective Nov. 13.
The Office of Legal Counsel, which reports to the Chair, develops policy guidance, provides technical assistance to employers and employees, and coordinates with other agencies and stakeholders regarding the statutes and regulations enforced by the
Commission.</p>
<p>Carol Miaskoff, who has been serving as acting associate legal counsel since Oct. 1, is moving up from her position as assistant legal counsel for the Title VII, ADEA, and EPA Division.  During her career at the EEOC, she also has served as
assistant legal counsel for coordination, representing the EEOC to other federal departments and agencies that regulate the workplace.  She has done extensive legal work under all the statutes enforced by the EEOC and, most recently, supervised
the development of Commission policy documents about retaliation, harassment, national origin discrimination, and equal pay.  Prior to joining the EEOC, Miaskoff worked for the law firm of Steptoe &amp; Johnson and clerked for U.S. District
Judge George Revercomb in Washington, D.C. She holds a J.D. with high honors from the George Washington University Law School, where she served on the law review, and an A.B. from Harvard University in psychology and social relations. She has served
on numerous EEOC task forces and has represented the agency to the American Bar Association's Section of Labor and Employment Law, Federal Labor Standards Legislation Committee.  She speaks frequently to labor and employment groups.</p>
<p>"I have been privileged to contribute to the EEOC's important mission and to work with its knowledgeable and committed staff.  I look forward to the agency's continued work to implement our nation's commitment to equal employment opportunity
for all workers."</p>
<p>Haffer comes to the EEOC from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), where he has spent the last 25 years leading data analytics, research, research administration, measurement, performance improvement and reporting initiatives.
His most recent position was director of the Data and Policy Analytics Group in the CMS Office of Minority Health, where he led enterprise-wide research and statistical activities that related to identifying and eliminating health disparities in
under-served populations. A highly skilled data scientist and statistician, Chris has authored and co-authored dozens of articles in prominent peer-reviewed journals and is a frequent speaker at various conferences and events. Chris holds a
bachelor's degree from Loyola College, and a master of policy sciences and Ph.D. from the University of Maryland Graduate School, Baltimore. ORIP aids the Commission in achieving its mission by researching, collecting and analyzing employer, charge
and enforcement data; designing approaches to enhance methods of performance measurement and performance improvement; and providing resource, technical and research support to the Commission and the public.</p>
<p>Haffer said, "High-quality, privacy-protected data are an incredible asset that helps the agency provide reliable, important information to the public. As chief data officer and director of the Office of Research, Information and Planning, I look
forward to collaborating with my colleagues, employers and other stakeholders to streamline reporting, explore new ways to use data more efficiently, and create state-of-the-art information products."</p>
