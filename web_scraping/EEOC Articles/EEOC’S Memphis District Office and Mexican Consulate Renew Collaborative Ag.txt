<p>MEMPHIS - The Memphis District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) renewed its memorandum of understanding (MOU) today with the Consulate of Mexico in Atlanta. The agreement renews an ongoing collaboration between

Katharine W. Kores signed the agreement.</p>
<p>"Stopping unlawful employment discrimination against immigrant, migrant and other vulnerable workers is an EEOC priority," said EEOC District Director Katharine Kores. "This agreement continues our collaboration to work together to ensure that
vulnerable workers understand their rights and are protected from discrimination."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the Memphis District Office will work with the Mexican consulate to collaborate on education and outreach efforts to ensure that Mexican nationals are aware of applicable workplace laws and
regulations, and a system for referring complaints to EEOC.</p>
<p>Consul General Diaz de Leon said, "The implementation of the employment rights of every Mexican national in this country, no matter what their immigration status may be, is a priority for the Mexican government. This MOU is an essential tool to
achieve this goal."</p>
