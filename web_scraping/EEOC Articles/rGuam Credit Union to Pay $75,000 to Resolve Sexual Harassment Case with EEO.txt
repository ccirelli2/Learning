<h1>Guam Credit Union to Pay $75,000 to Resolve Sexual Harassment Case with EEOC</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>HONOLULU, Hawaii - Maite, Guam-based Coast 360 Federal Credit Union will pay $75,000 and furnish other relief to settle a sexual harassment case with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today. The credit
union also agreed to implement measures to prevent future incidents of harassment.</p>
<p>In February 2012, a male employee filed a charge with the EEOC alleging that he was sexually harassed by a member of the credit union in 2011, including gestures of a sexual nature. The EEOC ultimately found reasonable cause that the credit union
violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for the sexual harassment to which the victim was subjected.</p>
<p>Without admitting liability, Coast 360 Federal Credit Union agreed to enter into a conciliation agreement with the EEOC and the alleged victim, thereby avoiding litigation. Aside from the monetary relief, the credit union agreed to hire a
consultant or attorney to provide all employees with live training on how to address and prevent sex discrimination, sexual harassment and retaliation in the workplace. The credit union also agreed to appoint an internal equal employment opportunity
officer to review and revise the credit union's anti-harassment policy and complaint procedures as needed. The EEOC will monitor compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p>"Federal law prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace, and employers have the responsibility to protect their staff from such misconduct," said Timothy Riera, director of the EEOC's Honolulu Local Office, which includes Guam in its
jurisdiction. "We are pleased that Coast 360 worked with the EEOC to reach a resolution that will both prevent sexual harassment and ensure that such issues are properly addressed going forward."</p>
<p>Addressing systemic harassment in the workplace is one of the six national priorities identified by the EEOC's Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP).</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
