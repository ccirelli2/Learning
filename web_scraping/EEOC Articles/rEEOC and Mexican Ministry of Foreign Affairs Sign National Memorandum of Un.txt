<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Agreement Will Strengthen Collaboration Aimed at Educating Immigrant Workers of Their Rights Under U.S. Anti-Discrimination Laws</em></strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Mexican States signed a <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/mous/eeoc_mexico_mou.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=191816,eeoc_mexico_mou.cfm,136|">national Memorandum of Understanding</a> (MOU) today which is designed to further strengthen their collaborative efforts to provide immigrant, migrant and otherwise vulnerable Mexican workers and
their employers with guidance and information and access to education about their rights and responsibilities under the laws enforced by the EEOC.</p>
<p>"Stopping and remedying unlawful employment discrimination against immigrant, migrant and other vulnerable workers is an EEOC priority," said EEOC Chair Jacqueline A. Berrien.  "We look forward to continuing the dialogue on ways to stop and
remedy discrimination for all workers.  We are building on many existing relationships between EEOC offices and Mexican consulates across the country, and are now able to partner with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Mexican States
to protect vulnerable workers throughout the United States of America."</p>
<p>Mexican Ambassador Eduardo Medina said, "This Memorandum of Understanding formalizes a fruitful and standing relationship between Mexico and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The joint efforts of the Embassy and the Mexican Consular
Network in the United States with the EEOC empower Mexican workers in this country to safeguard their labor rights and stand against employment discrimination."</p>
<p>This national MOU exemplifies the overall intent of the EEOC and the Mexican Embassy to continue the efforts to assist the Mexican community.  Under the national framework of the MOU, the two entities will cooperate to provide outreach and
training, as well as assist with enforcement efforts as needed.</p>
<p>EEOC Chair Jacqueline A. Berrien and Ambassador Eduardo Medina Mora signed the MOU in English and in Spanish on Aug. 29, 2014 at EEOC Headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The EEOC is the federal agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
