the Workplace</a>, and the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/labor_law/committees/eeocom.html">Equal Employment Opportunity Committee of the ABA Section of Labor and Employment Law</a> will host <em><a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/cra50th/">The Civil Rights Act @ 50: "The Pioneering Role of Flight Attendants in Fighting Sex Discrimination</a></em>," on Thursday, Oct. 23 at Ogilvie Auditorium, IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law (565 West Adams
Street, Chicago).  The event will begin at 10:00 a.m., and doors will open at 9:30 a.m.</p>
<p>The event will explore the pivotal role flight attendants played in the enforcement of the prohibition by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against sex discrimination in the workplace.  The program will include remarks from
<strong>Chair Jenny Yang</strong> and <strong>Commissioner Victoria Lipnic</strong> of theU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), <strong>Dean Harold Krent</strong> of the IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law, and other sponsors.</p>
<p>Commissioner Lipnic will also moderate a panel with <strong>Mary Celeste Lansdale Brodigan</strong>, plaintiff in <u>Lansdale v. United Air Lines, Inc.</u>; <strong>Mary Pat Laffey,</strong> plaintiff in <u>Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.</u>;
<strong>Patricia Friend,</strong> former international president, Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO; <strong>Sonia Fuentes,</strong> former attorney, Office of General Counsel, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission;

Law.</p>
<p>Panelists Mary Celeste (Lansdale) Brodigan and Mary Pat Laffey brought groundbreaking cases against the airline industry during the early days of Title VII enforcement.  Lansdale challenged and overturned United's policy of discharging
female, but not male, employees upon marrying.  Laffey, a case brought under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act, resulted in findings that Northwest treated male and female flight attendants differently in areas of hiring, pay, promotions,
benefits, and weight monitoring.</p>
<p>The event will also feature excerpts from the Association of Flight Attendants' documentary "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKbn905qohI">Turbulent Romance: The History of AFA</a>." </p>
