<h1>Access Services, Inc. Breached Mediation Agreement, EEOC Charges</h1>

<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Federal Agency Sues Company For Failing to Pay All Money Agreed to in Settlement</em></strong></p>
<p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. – A Charlotte, N.C.-based operator of janitorial services violated federal law when it failed to abide by the terms of a voluntary mediation settlement agreement it entered into with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the EEOC charged in a lawsuit filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s complaint, on October 20, 2009, Access Services, Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the EEOC and Luis Rodriguez, a former employee, to settle a charge of employment discrimination filed by Rodriguez. As part of that agreement, the company agreed to pay $6,000 in a monetary relief to Rodriguez. The company has failed to make full payment, despite the fact the EEOC modified the payment terms twice at the company’s request.</p>
<p>After first attempting to resolve the matter informally, the EEOC filed suit (<em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Access Services</em>, Inc., 3:11-cv-00334), in U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division. The agency seeks payment of the outstanding balance and appropriate injunctive relief.</p>
<p>Mediation is a form of alternative dispute resolution or ADR that is offered by the EEOC as an alternative to the agency’s traditional investigative process. The mediation process allows the individual who filed a charge - called a “charging party" - and the company against whom the charge was filed, to meet and try to work out their differences with the assistance of a neutral mediator. The process is informal and voluntary, and both parties must agree to participate. The goal is to complete the mediation with a voluntary, negotiated resolution of the subject charge.</p>
<p>“When a company signs a settlement agreement with the EEOC and a charging party  - whether the agreement occurs during mediation, investigation, or conciliation - the EEOC expects the company to honor such an agreement,” said Lynette A. Barnes, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Charlotte District Office. “Companies that voluntarily agree to settle a charge and then renege, will find that the EEOC taking all appropriate steps - including suit - to ensure that they comply with settlement agreements.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC and its mediation program is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
