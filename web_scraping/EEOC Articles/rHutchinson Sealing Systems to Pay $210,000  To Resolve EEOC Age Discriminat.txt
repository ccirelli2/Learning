<h1>Hutchinson Sealing Systems to Pay $210,000  To Resolve EEOC Age Discrimination Claim</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Three Older Employees Targeted During 'Reduction in Force,' Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>DETROIT - Hutchinson Sealing Systems, Inc., an automotive sealing systems manufacturer based in Auburn Hills, Mich., will pay $210,000 to three of its former engineers to settle an age discrimination lawsuit by the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, Hutchinson Sealing Systems violated the law by selecting three engineers for termination during staff cuts based on their ages. At the time of their firing, the engineers were ages 48, 51 and 62.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age over 40 in any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, layoff, pay, promotions, job assignments and fringe
benefits. The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 2:12-CV-10264 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan), after first attempting to resolve the matter through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>In addition to the monetary payment, the consent decree settling the suit requires Hutchinson Sealing Systems to receive substantive training which will cover the provisions of the ADEA and employment practices deemed unlawful under the federal
law, including the use of age as a basis to select employees for layoff or termination.</p>
<p>"This is a favorable resolution for everyone," said EEOC attorney Omar Weaver. "Hutchinson Sealing's willingness to resolve this case without prolonged litigation is commendable."</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
