<h1>EEOC Sues Rivers Casino for Firing Employee Who Needed Time Off for Cancer Treatment</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Casino Violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by Refusing Time Off for Cancer Surgery, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong> </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">CHICAGO - Rivers Casino in Des Plaines violated federal law prohibiting disability discrim­ination by denying an employee's request for additional leave to get cancer treatment and then firing him, the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed today.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">According to Julianne Bowman, the EEOC's district director in Chicago, the EEOC's pre-suit investigation revealed that Rivers Casinos wrongfully denied Donnan Lake's request for a reason­able accommodation of a few additional
weeks of leave to have surgery related to his cancer. Lake suffers from sarcoma and has required chemotherapy and surgery to treat his cancer.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for otherwise qualified employees with disa­bilities, include providing medical leave if
does not present an undue burden to the employer.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The EEOC filed yesterday's suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The case (<em>EEOC v. Midwest Gaming LLC, dba Rivers Casino</em>, Civil Action No. 17-cv-6811 was
filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division and assigned to Judge Rubin Castillo.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">"Employers need to be reminded that a limited request for medical leave can be a reasonable accommodation and employers risk violating the law if they summarily deny such requests," said Greg Gochanour, regional attorney of
the EEOC's Chicago District Office.  "Mr. Lake was a good employee who just needed a little more time to fight his cancer. It is unfortunate that Rivers ignored its obligations under the ADA and fired him while he was trying to fight his
cancer."</p>
