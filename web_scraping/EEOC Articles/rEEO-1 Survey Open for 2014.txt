<h1>EEO-1 Survey Open for 2014</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Private Sector Employers Must Provide Workforce Data to EEOC By Sept. 30</strong></em></p>
<p>Washington -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has completed its mailing of the 2014 EEO-1 survey Notification Letters.  The EEO-1 is an annual survey that requires all private employers with 100 or more employees, and federal
government contractors or first-tier subcontractors with 50 or more employees and a contract/subcontract of $50,000 or more to file the EEO-1 report.  The filing of the EEO-1 report is not voluntary, and is required by federal law.  The
annual filing deadline is September 30, 2014.  </p>
<p>The EEO-1 report provides valuable employment data by race/ethnicity, gender and job categories, and is used by researchers, private attorneys, human resource staff in developing affirmative action plans, and in the Commission's enforcement of
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p>Employers who meet the criteria listed above or employers that filed the EEO-1 report in 2013 and have not received the 2014 EEO-1 Notification Letter by the end of July, 2014 should immediately contact the EEO-1 Joint Reporting Committee at
866.286.6440 (toll-free) or e-mail at <a href="mailto:e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov" id="mailto:e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov|">e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov</a>.  If you have any questions about the EEO-1 survey, please contact the EEO-1 Joint
Reporting Committee at 866.286.6440 (toll-free) or by email, at <a href="mailto:e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov" id="mailto:e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov|">e1.techassistance@eeoc.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Deidre M. Flippen, Director of the Office of Research, Information and Planning, points out that, "This year we continue our efforts to make it easier for employers to file by providing more technical assistance guidance in the form of a postal
code lookup table, sample self-identification forms, and the ability for employers who upload their data files, to test their data files for errors prior to upload.  These new tools will assist employers in meeting the September 30
deadline."</p>
