<h1>EEOC Seeks Public Input in Developing Strategic Enforcement Plan</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>In February 2012, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) approved a <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/strategic_plan_12to16.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=152890,strategic_plan_12to16.cfm,9|">Strategic Plan</a> for Fiscal Years 2012 – 2016. The Strategic Plan establishes a framework for achieving the EEOC’s mission to stop and remedy unlawful employment discrimination by focusing on strategic law enforcement, education and outreach, and efficiently serving the public.  The first performance measure of the plan requires the Commission to approve a Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP).  The Commission is now developing the SEP and would like input from the public.   We encourage participation from individuals, employers, advocacy groups, agency stakeholders and other interested parties.</p>
<p>While no specific format is required, we are most interested in what the EEOC’s national priorities should be for the next three years to have the greatest impact in combating discrimination in the workplace; and recommendations for improving enforcement, outreach and prevention, and customer service.  Please also include a contact email and/or mailing address.</p>
<p>Suggestions must be submitted by 5:00 pm EDT on June 19, 2012  to strategic.plan@eeoc.gov or received by mail at <strong><em>Executive Officer, Office of the Executive Secretariat, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 131 M Street, NE, Washington, DC 20507</em></strong>.   </p>
<p>All submissions will be reviewed for possible inclusion in a future Commission meeting in Washington, D.C. on the development of the SEP.  If selected, the author or a representative would be invited to testify before the Commission in person, via phone, or via live video.</p>
<p>For general inquiries about the 2012 Strategic Plan or the development of the SEP, please email <a href="mailto:strategic.plan@eeoc.gov" id="mailto:strategic.plan@eeoc.gov|">strategic.plan@eeoc.gov</a> or call (202) 663-4070/(TTY: 202-663-4494).
