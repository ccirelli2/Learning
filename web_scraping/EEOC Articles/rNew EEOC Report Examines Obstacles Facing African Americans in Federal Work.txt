<h1>New EEOC Report Examines Obstacles Facing African Americans in Federal Workplace</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Seven Impediments, Underlying Issues, Recommendations Identified by Work Group</strong></em></p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today issued a comprehensive report addressing major obstacles hindering equal opportunities for African Americans in the federal work force, in addition to highlighting
stakeholder recommendations.  The report is available on EEOC's website at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/federal/reports/aawg.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=170230,aawg.cfm,30|">http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/reports/aawg.cfm</a>.</p>
<p>The report, prepared by an internal agency work group, is based upon in-depth research and widespread consultations with key federal stakeholder groups representing African Americans, as well as other affinity organizations (referred to in the
report as "dialogue partners").</p>
<p>"This report is timely because it coincides with the Commission's recently approved Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2012-2016," said Carlton Hadden, director of EEOC's Office of Federal Operations. "This effort is the latest step in an ongoing
dialogue with agency stakeholders to effectuate a model federal workplace for <em>all</em> employees."</p>
<p>Following are the seven obstacles identified in the <em>EEOC African American Workgroup Report</em>:<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Unconscious biases and perceptions about African Americans still play a significant role in employment decisions in the federal sector.</li>
<li>African Americans lack adequate mentoring and networking opportunities for higher-level and management positions.</li>
<li>Insufficient training and development assignments perpetuate inequalities in skills and opportunities for African Americans.</li>
<li>Narrow recruitment methods negatively impact African Americans.</li>
<li>The perception of widespread inequality among African Americans in the federal work force hinders their career advancement.</li>
<li>Educational requirements create obstacles for African Americans in the federal work force.</li>
<li>EEO regulations and laws are not adequately followed by agencies and are not effectively enforced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the seven obstacles highlighted in the report contain background information, as well as underlying issues and specific recommendations from the work group's dialogue partners - who independently and repeatedly identified the
aforementioned impediments.  The report is being issued to memorialize the obstacles and recommendations of EEOC's dialogue partners.</p>
<p>EEOC's dialogue partners in the report included:<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Blacks in Government (BIG)</li>
<li>African American Federal Executives Association (AAFEA)</li>
<li>Federally Employed Women (FEW)</li>

<li>The Equal Justice Society</li>
<li>The Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia</li>
<li>Workplace Flexibility 2010</li>

</ul>
<p>The work group also received valuable input from academic expert Dr. Paula Caplan of the W.E.B. Dubois Institute at Harvard University.</p>
