about their workplace rights," said EEOC Chair Jenny Yang.  "The EEOC is committed to stopping and remedying unlawful employment discrimination against immigrant, migrant and other vulnerable workers."</p>
<p>Philippine Ambassador Jose L. Cuisia, Jr. said, "We are pleased at being able to formalize our alliance with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and collaborate closely towards ensuring that Filipino nationals working in the United States
are accorded equal opportunities at their workplace."</p>
<p>This national MOU exemplifies the overall intent of the EEOC and the Philippine Embassy to continue the efforts to assist the Philippine community.  Under the national framework of the MOU, the two entities will cooperate to provide outreach
and training, as well as assist with enforcement efforts as needed.</p>
