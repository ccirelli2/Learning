<h1>Marymount Manhattan College Settles EEOC Age Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>College  Pays $125,000 to 64-Year-Old Applicant</em></strong></p>
<p>NEW YORK - Marymount Manhattan College has settled a lawsuit  filed by EEOC alleging that it refused to hire a choreography instructor for a  tenure-track assistant professorship because of her age.  Marymount is a private liberal
arts college  located in New York City.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, Marymount passed over a  64-year-old applicant for an assistant professorship in dance composition who  had been working at Marymount, and instead hired a 38-year-old applicant.  The suit charged that
this violated the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), which prohibits age discrimination  against employees and job applicants who are age 40 or older.</p>
<p>By  the terms of the consent decree settling the suit, Marymount agreed to pay  $125,000 to Patricia Catterson.   Further, it agrees to comply with the  requirements of the ADEA.  The decree  also requires
monitoring and training on anti-discrimination law.  The decree will last for four years. </p>
<p>"We commend Marymount for working cooperatively with us to  resolve this matter," said EEOC New York Trial Attorney Louis Graziano.  "We are confident that we have put mechanisms  in place to ensure compliance with the law in the
future."</p>
<p>New York District Director EEOC Kevin Berry  said, "Under the law, age has no place in making hiring decisions - and  tenure-track positions in academia are no exception.</p>
<p>The  EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further  information about the EEOC is available on the agency's web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
