<div align="left"><p align="center"><em><strong>Agency Charges Georgia Military College Subjected African-American Groundskeeper to Racial Abuse</strong></em></p>
<p>ATLANTA  - Georgia Military College violated federal law by committing race discrimination at its Milledgeville, Ga., location, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit that it filed yesterday. </p>
<p>In its lawsuit, Civil Action No., 5:11-cv-00023,  filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, Macon division, the EEOC alleges that Georgia Military College Foundation, Inc., doing business as Georgia Military College, subjected Solomon Mosley, an African-American groundskeeper, to a racially hostile work environment over a four-year period. </p>
<p>Race discrimination violates Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>The federal agency seeks compensatory and punitive damages for the harmed employee, as well as injunctive relief designed to prevent such discrimination in the future.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency’s web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
