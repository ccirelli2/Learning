<h1>New ‘Digest of EEO Law’ Issued by EEOC</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Quarterly Edition Includes Variety of Key Federal Sector Decisions</em></strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today announced the latest edition of its federal sector Digest of Equal Employment Opportunity Law, which is available online at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/digest/xxiv-3.cfm" id="http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/digest/xxiv-3.cfm|">http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/digest/xxiv-3.cfm</a>.</p>
<p>This quarterly publication, prepared by the EEOC's Office of Federal Operations (OFO), features recent agency decisions and federal court cases of interest. It also includes a special article entitled, Retaliation: An Evolving Area of the
Law.</p>
<p>"The Digest's focus on retaliation should be particularly useful," said OFO Director Carlton M. Hadden, "as that continues to be the most frequently alleged basis for EEO complaints. The article provides solid information on recent decisions and
cases."</p>
<p>The summer 2013 edition of the Digest contains a sampling of summaries of noteworthy decisions selected by OFO from among the volume of decisions issued by EEOC each fiscal year, including topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal Sector EEO Complaint Processing</li>
<li>Attorneys' Fees</li>
<li>Compensatory Damages</li>
<li>Findings on the Merits</li>
<li>Remedies</li>
<li>Sanctions</li>
<li>Settlement Agreements</li>
<li>Stating a Claim</li>
<li>Summary Judgment</li>
<li>Official Time</li>
</ul>
<p>While these summaries are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive as to their subject matter, and may not be given the legal weight of case law in citations, they are a good source of relevant information.</p>
<p>In addition to the quarterly Digest, Commission federal sector decisions are available on the EEOC's website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/decisions.cfm" id="http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/decisions.cfm|">http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/decisions.cfm</a>. The public may also receive federal sector information updates and news items via Twitter: @EEOC_OFO.</p>
