<h1>Findlay Honda to Pay $150,000 to Resolve EEOC Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>

<p>LAS VEGAS – Shack-Findlay Automotive, LLC, doing  business as Findlay Honda and Findlay Automotive Group, Inc., a car dealership  in Henderson, Nev., will pay $150,000 to two black  employees for subjecting them to discrimination, harassment and retaliation, the  U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today.</p>
<p>The EEOC filed suit against the  company on behalf of the two individuals in September 2010 in the U.S. District  Court for the District of Nevada (<em>EEOC v.  Shack-Findlay Automotive, LLC d/b/a Findlay Honda and Findlay Automotive Group,  Inc.</em>, Case No. 2:10-cv-01692-KJD-RJJ).  In its lawsuit, the EEOC asserted that a parts department manager made  racially derogatory comments and jokes on a near-daily basis and imposed  stricter work-related rules on black employees than non-black employees. Two black employees were eventually fired,  one after communicating that he was going to file a discrimination charge against  the company.</p>
<p>Race discrimination and retaliation  for complaining about it violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of  1964. The EEOC filed suit after first  attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation  process.</p>
<p>Findlay  Honda agreed to enter into a consent decree with the EEOC resolving the matter.  Aside from the monetary relief for the  victims, the consent decree also requires that the company hire an outside EEO  consultant; distribute its policies and complaint procedures with respect to  workplace discrimination, harassment and retaliation; track future complaints; and  provide annual equal employment opportunity training.</p>
<p>“We commend Shack-Findlay  Automotive for taking proactive measures to ensure a workplace free of  discrimination,” said Anna Y. Park, regional attorney of the EEOC’s Los Angeles  District Office, whose jurisdiction includes Nevada.  “We encourage other employers to take steps to ensure that managers are  trained about their obligations under Title VII.”</p>
<p>Adriana Lopez, acting local director  for the EEOC’s Las Vegas Local Office, added, “Retaliation is the No. 1 type of  complaint filed with the EEOC nationwide and also in our district. Workers are increasingly aware that they have  the right to report discrimination and harassment without reprisal by  employers. We encourage employers to  take preventative measures to combat this form of discrimination.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws  prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov.</a></p></div>
