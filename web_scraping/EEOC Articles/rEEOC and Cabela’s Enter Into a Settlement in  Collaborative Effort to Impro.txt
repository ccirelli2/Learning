</div>

<p>CHICAGO - Cabela's Incorporated, a leading retailer of fishing, camping, and hunting equipment and apparel, has entered into a nationwide agreement to strengthen and improve its hiring and recruiting practices of minorities, the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today. These actions are based on a settlement agreement with the federal agency that resolves an EEOC Commissioner's Charge of Discrimination alleging that Cabela's failed to recruit and hire
minorities.</p>
<p>A central focus of the agreement is strengthening Cabela's diversity efforts, including appointment of a Director of Diversity and Inclusion who reports directly to the Chief Administrative Officer of Cabela's. The company also agreed to hiring
goals to achieve parity in the hiring rates of white and minority applicants; adding equal employment opportunity (EEO) compliance as a component in the performance evaluation system for management and supervisory personnel; and updated EEO policies
and annual training on EEO issues for all employees.</p>
<p>"Two critical elements in demonstrating commitment to diversity and inclusion in an organization are first, buy-in from senior management, and second, the message has to be it is right for our business. Cabela's has demonstrated this commitment,"
according to Julianne Bowman, director of the EEOC's Chicago District Office, who added, "Based on communications from senior management and actions taken by Cabela's throughout the investigation process, Cabela's has made great strides to improve
its hiring and recruiting practices, and based on collaborative efforts with the EEOC, Cabela's has demonstrated its commitment to continuing these efforts."</p>
<p>According to Cabela's CEO, Tommy Millner, "Diversity and inclusion is one of my most important initiatives at Cabela's, and I am extremely pleased that we were able to work jointly with the EEOC in continuing to strengthen efforts that have been
underway for the past several years at Cabela's."</p>
<p>Cabela's Incorporated, headquartered in Sidney, Nebraska, has 60 retail stores in 33 states. EEOC's Chicago District Office is responsible for processing charges of discrimination, administrative enforcement and the conduct of agency litigation
in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and North and South Dakota, with Area Offices in Milwaukee and Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
