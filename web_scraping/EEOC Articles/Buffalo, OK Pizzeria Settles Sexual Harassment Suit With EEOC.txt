<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>EEOC Alleged Pizza Pub Manager Sexually Harassed Teen Employee</em></strong></p>
<p>OKLAHOMA CITY – Educominc, LLC, doing business as Pizza Pub in Buffalo, Oklahoma, will pay $40,000 to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).</p>
<p>The EEOC had alleged that the manager of Pizza Pub had subjected an 18-year old female worker to physical touching and verbal comments of a sexual nature, including telling her that he wanted to lick frosting off her body. The employee objected to his behavior but when it continued, she quit her job.</p>
<p>The proposed consent decree was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma (Cause No. 09-1007). In addition to paying $40,000 in backpay and damages to the former employee, Pizza Pub agreed to a five year consent decree which includes training of employees as to the requirements of Title VII and the posting of a notice that will notify employees of their rights. The consent decree also applies to Core Curriculum of America, Inc. and Curriculum Solutions, Inc., companies which are closely related to Educominc, LLC.</p>
<p>“Teenage workers are especially vulnerable to sexual harassment in the workplace and must be protected. The EEOC will remain vigilant in its enforcement of federal laws prohibiting such discrimination in the workplace,” said Barbara A. Seely, regional attorney of the EEOC’s St. Louis District Office, which is responsible for the agency’s litigation in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
