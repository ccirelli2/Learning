<h1>Nevada Health Centers Settles EEOC Sex Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Health Care Provider Discharged Male Employee Because of His Gender, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>LAS VEGAS - Nevada Health Centers will pay $35,000 and provide other relief to resolve a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Oppor­tunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, from 2010 to 2013, Nevada Health Centers and Ultracare Las Vegas had a service contract whereby the placement agency Ultracare provided Nevada Health with ultra­sound technicians. In November 2012, Ultracare hired
David Matlock as an ultrasound technician and placed him at Nevada Health. Within weeks of his placement, Nevada Health asked Ultracare to remove Mr. Matlock solely because of his gender. Ultracare complied with Nevada Health's request and
terminated Matlock's employment at Nevada Health in the first week of January 2013.</p>
<p>The EEOC filed suit in June 2016, charging that Nevada Health and Ultracare terminated David Matlock because of his gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [<em>EEOC v. Nevada Health Centers, Inc, Ultracare Las
Vegas</em>, Case No. 2:16-cv-01495-JAD-PAL]. Ultracare entered into a settlement agreement with the EEOC for $15,000, which was approved by the Court on March 20. The court approved the consent decree as to the remaining defendant, Nevada Health
Centers, on July 6. </p>
<p>In addition to monetary relief, Nevada Health will implement injunctive relief focused on ensuring equal employment opportunities for its employees, regardless of gender. The company agreed to review and revise its anti-discrimination policy to
ensure it prohibits discrimination and contains a process for prompt handling of discrimination complaints. Nevada Health also agreed train its manage­ment on the importance of non-discrimination in the recruitment and hiring of its employees, and
further agreed to report any gender discrimination complaints and provide reports on its recruitment and hiring practices. The EEOC will monitor compliance with the two-and-a-half-year decree.</p>
<p>"Outdated stereotypes in the health care industry cannot be used to categorically exclude emp­loyees from certain jobs based on gender," said Anna Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles District Office, which includes Las Vegas in its
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Christine Park-Gonzalez, acting local director of the EEOC's Las Vegas Local Office, added, "Employers have an obligation to comply with the prohibition on sex discrimination in federal law and should examine their practices to ensure that gender
bias is not impacting employment decisions."</p>
<p>According to its website, <a href="http://www.nevadahealthcenters.org">www.nevadahealthcenters.org</a>, Nevada Health Centers is a non-profit organization that provides 15 health center locations and mobile service providers throughout
Nevada.</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employ­ment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the latest EEOC news by
