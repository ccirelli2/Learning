<p>WASHINGTON – Jacqueline A. Berrien, Chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), has appointed Malcolm Medley, a veteran civil rights attorney, as district director of the EEOC’s Miami District Office, which also oversees offices in Tampa, Fla., and San Juan, P.R.</p>
<p>“I am honored to have this opportunity and by the confidence that Chair Berrien has shown in me by my selection,” said Medley. “I am excited about joining the Commission’s efforts to proactively combat discrimination nationwide and to continue civil rights enforcement efforts in this district. I am particularly passionate about fighting systemic discrimination, which is a critical, intrinsic and ongoing part of the EEOC’s work.”</p>
<p>Medley has previously litigated various employment and civil rights cases in federal and state courts on behalf of individual, municipal and corporate clients in federal and state appeals courts, as well as before state and federal administrative agencies. As a special assistant corporation counsel with the city of Boston, Medley represented the Boston Public School Department in discrimination cases, traditional labor negotiation and disputes, disciplinary proceedings and grievance arbitrations. Medley served as an arbitrator on the American Arbitration Association’s National Roster of Employment and Commercial Arbitrators.</p>
<p>Medley is the outgoing chairman of the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD). He was appointed to that position by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick in November 2007. As chairman, Medley led an organization of investigators, fact finders, attorneys and others who enforced federal civil rights laws. In addition to his administrative functions, Medley oversaw all regulatory, enforcement and adjudicatory functions of the MCAD.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
