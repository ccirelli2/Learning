<p>JACKSON, Miss. - The Birmingham District of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the New Orleans Consulate of Mexico at the EEOC's Jackson Area Office in Jackson on May
23.  The agreement establishes an ongoing collaborative relationship between these two entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace, regardless of
documentation status.  Andrea García Guerra, consul general of Mexico in New Orleans, and Delner Franklin-Thomas, director of the EEOC's Birmingham District, will sign the agreement.</p>
<p>"This pact will enhance and carry forward both entities' missions - promoting employment justice and protecting people's basic human rights," said Franklin-Thomas.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the MOU, the EEOC will expand its cooperation with the Mexican Consulate, providing it with Spanish-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the EEOC.  The EEOC will also provide representatives to meet with
Mexican nationals in Mississippi in order to disseminate information and conduct counseling regarding employment discrimination matters.</p>
<p>The EEOC and the Mexican Consulate will work together regularly to provide information regarding workplace discrimination on Spanish-language radio stations throughout their respective jurisdictions. </p>
<p>The Mexican Consulate in New Orleans provides services to preserve the rights of Mexican nationals residing in Mississippi and Louisiana.  The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment.  The
EEOC's Birmingham District includes Alabama, Mississippi (except 17 northern counties) and the Florida Panhandle.</p>
