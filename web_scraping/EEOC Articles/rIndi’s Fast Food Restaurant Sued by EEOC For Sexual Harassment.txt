<h1>Indi’s Fast Food Restaurant Sued by EEOC For Sexual Harassment</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Restaurant Subjected Female Employees to Egregious Sexual Harassment Including Requests for Sex, Federal Agency Charges </em></strong></p>
<p>INDIANAPOLIS -- Louisville, Ky.-based restaurant chain Indi's Fast Food Restaurants, Inc. subjected a class of female employees to pervasive sexual harassment in violation of federal law, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
charged in a lawsuit announced today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, a manager at the company's Cane Run Road location in Louisville subjected Rickesha Jones and a class of similarly female employees to long-standing sexual harassment, including requests for sexual favors, sexually
offensive comments and unwanted sexual touching.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC, Indi's failed to take prompt action to stop the sexual harassment even though the offensive conduct and comments were blatant and pervasive. Jones and other female employees complained about the harassment to other
managers, who all failed to act.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit (Civil Action No. 3:15-cv-00590) in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, Louisville Division, after first attempting to reach a
pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. In its suit, the EEOC seeks compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief.</p>
<p>"No employee should have to endure severe or pervasive sexual harassment in order to earn a living," said EEOC Indianapolis District Office Regional Attorney Laurie Young. "When companies tolerate sexual harassment, the EEOC will take action to
protect employees."</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
