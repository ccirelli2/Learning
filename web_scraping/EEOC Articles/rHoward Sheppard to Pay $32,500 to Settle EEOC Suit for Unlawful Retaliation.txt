<p>ATLANTA – Howard Sheppard, Inc., a family-owned trucking company, will pay $32,500 to settle a retaliation lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>The EEOC had alleged that Sheppard fired truck driver Sarah Waller in retaliation for having made complaints about sexual harassment.</p>
<p>In addition to the monetary relief, the consent decree settling the suit includes provisions for equal employment opportunity training, reporting to the EEOC and posting of anti-discrimination notices. Sheppard denied any liability or wrongdoing in the suit.</p>
<p>Robert Dawkins, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Atlanta office, said, “By coming forward with her discrimination charge, Ms. Waller’s efforts will go a long way towards preventing future mistreatment of female truck drivers.”</p>
<p>Sheppard employs over 400 truck drivers and other employees in Sandersville and other locations throughout Georgia.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
