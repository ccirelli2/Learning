<h1>ACM Services to Pay $415,000 to Settle EEOC Class Race, Gender Discrimination and Harassment Suit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Contractor Shunned Blacks and Women for Jobs, and Harassed and Fired Two Women for Opposing the Discrimination, Federal Agency Charged</strong></em></p>
<p>BALTIMORE - ACM Services, Inc., a Rockville, Md.-based environmental remediation services contractor, will pay $415,000 and provide comprehensive equitable relief to resolve a class race, gender discrimination and harassment lawsuit, the U.S.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today. The EEOC had charged that ACM Services engaged in a pattern or practice of race and sex discrimination in hiring and also harassed two women based on sex, race and national origin and
retaliated against them.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's suit, ACM Services exclusively used word-of-mouth recruitment practices for field laborer positions with the intent and effect of failing to recruit black job applicants. The EEOC said that ACM Services also refused to
hire black job applicants, or female applicants for field laborer positions. The EEOC also alleged failure to preserve employment applications.</p>
<p>The EEOC charged that ACM Services also subjected two Hispanic female employees to harassment based on sex, national origin, and race and engaged in unlawful retaliation against them because they opposed the harassment and discrimination and that
the retaliation resulted in their terminations. The EEOC also alleged that one of the Hispanic female employees was subjected to harassment because of her association with black persons.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, sex and national origin. Title VII also forbids employers from retaliating against individuals who oppose
discrimination. The EEOC filed its lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (<em>U.S. EEOC v. ACM Services, Inc</em>., Civil Action No. 8:14-CV-2997-PWG), after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its
conciliation process.</p>
<p>In addition to the $305,000 in monetary relief for a class of persons not hired or recruited because of race or sex and $110,000 in monetary relief to the two Hispanic female employees, the three-year consent decree resolving the lawsuit enjoins
ACM Services from engaging in any future race, sex, or national origin discrimination or retaliation, and provides substantial non-monetary relief.</p>
<p>Among other things, ACM Services will:</p>
<ul>
<li>implement numerical goals for hiring qualified black applicants and female applicants, including both permanent and temporary or contingent workers, for field laborer positions;</li>
<li>create a job opportunities advertisement program to recruit a diverse pool of qualified applicants for field laborer positions and refrain from using word-of-mouth recruiting as its sole method for seeking job applicants;</li>
<li>conduct extensive self-assessment of hiring and work assignment practices to ensure non-discrimination and compliance with the terms of the consent decree;</li>
<li>pay for advertising of the class claims process; and</li>
<li>submit reports to the EEOC concerning numerical hiring goals and other consent decree compliance issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>The EEOC will be conducting a claims process over the next 35 months to identify eligible claimants and determine awards.</p>
<p>"It is well-established that diversity is good for business," said EEOC Philadelphia District Director Spencer H. Lewis, Jr. "We encourage all employers to take a proactive approach in ensuring that their recruitment practices and workplaces are
free of discrimination."</p>
<p>EEOC Philadelphia Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence added, "We are pleased that ACM Services worked with us to resolve this lawsuit quickly and without engaging in protracted litigation. These affirmative measures will benefit all employees and
applicants. All employers should consider proactive measures to foster equal employment opportunities for job applicants and workers."</p>
<p>Eliminating barriers in recruitment and hiring, especially class-based recruitment and hiring practices that discriminate against racial, ethnic and religious groups, older workers, women, and people with disabilities, is one of six national
priorities identified by the EEOC's Strategic Enforcement Plan.</p>
<p>The EEOC Philadelphia District Office has jurisdiction over Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia and parts of New Jersey and Ohio.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the agency is available at its website, www.eeoc.gov.</p></div>
