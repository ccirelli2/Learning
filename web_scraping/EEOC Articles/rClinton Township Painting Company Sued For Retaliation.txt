<h1>Clinton Township Painting Company Sued For Retaliation</h1>

<p>DETROIT – A Clinton Township, Mich., industrial painting company illegally retaliated against a journeyman painter by terminating him for complaining about a supervisor’s use of the “N-word,” the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s suit, Case No. 2:11CV11296, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Atsalis Brothers Painting Company refused to call Rodney Trice back to work in retaliation for his complaints about a white supervisor’s repeated use of the racial slur. Trice said that the word was used repeatedly on the job site.</p>
<p>Retaliation against an employee for complaining about racial harassment violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The EEOC seeks injunctive relief to prevent the company from engaging in any further retaliatory employment practices, as well as monetary relief for Trice.</p>
<p>“Employees have a statutory right to complain about racial harassment without fear of reprisal,” said Laurie Young, regional attorney of the EEOC’s Indianapolis District Office, whose jurisdiction includes Michigan. “Employers are only making a bad situation worse when they punish their workers for opposing discriminatory behavior in the workplace.”</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
