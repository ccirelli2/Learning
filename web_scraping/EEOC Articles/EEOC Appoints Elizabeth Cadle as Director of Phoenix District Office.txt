<h1>EEOC Appoints Elizabeth Cadle as Director of Phoenix District Office</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON - Elizabeth (Isa) Cadle has been appointed district director of the Phoenix District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and as a member of the Senior Executive Service, effective Oct. 30, the federal
agency announced today.</p>
<p>"It is my pleasure to welcome Isa Cadle as the new director of the Phoenix District Office," said EEOC Chair Jenny R. Yang. "She has had a long and successful history with the agency, serving in a wide range of positions over her 40-year career
with EEOC. I know that she will continue her outstanding record of leadership in the years ahead."</p>
<p>Cadle has served as the deputy district director in Phoenix since 2011 and as acting district director since November 2015. Prior to serving in Phoenix, Cadle held positions as enforcement manager in the New York District Office and director for
the Buffalo Local Office.</p>
<p>Cadle began her 40-year EEOC career in Buffalo, N.Y., and progressed from clerk-typist to investigative assistant, investigator, and senior management positions. Cadle developed a strong expertise in systemic case development and served on the
2005 Systemic Task Force.</p>
<p>During her tenure in the Phoenix District, she directed the investigation of a number of high-impact cases. These cases included Patterson Drilling, a racial harassment case which resulted in a $14 million consent decree; Whitten Inn, where the
owner of several hotels forced employees to anglicize their names in order to work and fired employees in retaliation if they refused; Pitre Buick, a case where a class of males was subjected to egregious sexual harassment by a sales manager and
which settled for over $2 million; and MCM Elegante Hotel, which denied employment to a Muslim applicant because she wore a hijab, resolved via a consent decree with the discrimination victim receiving $100,000 and the employer changing its hiring
practices to allow for religious accommodation.</p>
<p>Cadle said she is honored to be selected as the new director and is looking forward to continuing her work in the Phoenix District Office.</p>
