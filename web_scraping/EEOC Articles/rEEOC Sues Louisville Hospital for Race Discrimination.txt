<h1>EEOC Sues Louisville Hospital for Race Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Jewish Hospital Fired Black Employee Because of Race, Federal Agency Charges</strong></em></p>
<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Jewish Hospital and St. Mary's Healthcare, Inc., a Louisville hospital, unlawfully fired an employee because he is African-American, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed
today. </p>
<p>According to the EEOC's lawsuit, Jewish Hospital terminated technician Phillip A. Pearson because of his race.  The EEOC said the hospital also inconsistently applied disciplinary procedures depending on employees' race.  </p>
<p>Race discrimination violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The EEOC asserts that the hospital's actions were intentional and demonstrated a reckless indifference to Pearson's federally protected rights. </p>
<p>The EEOC filed suit (Case No. 3:14-cv-00360 in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, Louisville Division) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The agency is seeking back
pay, compensatory and punitive damages against Jewish Hospital for Pearson as well as other relief, including a permanent injunction to prevent the company from engaging in future race discrimination.</p>
<p>"As the statute makes clear, discrimination on the basis of race is a violation of federal law," said Laurie Young, regional attorney for the EEOC's Indianapolis District Office.  "We are committed to pursuing the claims of individuals who
are denied the right to continue to work in their jobs and make a living because of their race." </p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
