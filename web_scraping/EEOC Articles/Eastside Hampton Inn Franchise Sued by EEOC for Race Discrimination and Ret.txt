<h1>Eastside Hampton Inn Franchise Sued by EEOC for Race Discrimination and Retaliation</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><em><strong>Indianapolis Hotel Discriminated Against Black Housekeeping Applicants and Staff, Federal Agency Charged</strong></em></p>
<p>INDIANAPOLIS – A local hotel has denied employment to black housekeeping applicants,  offered lower pay and hours to black housekeeping staff, terminated black housekeeping staff who complained of the less favorable treatment, and destroyed employment records since at least September 2, 2008, according to a lawsuit filed on September 30, 2010 by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). </p>
<p>According to the EEOC, the general manager of the Hampton Inn hotel located at 2311 North Shadeland Ave. advised her employees that she wanted to get “Mexicans” in who would clean better and complain less than her black housekeeping staff.  The EEOC is suing New Indianapolis Hotels, Inc. on behalf of a class of terminated housekeeping employees as well as a class of black housekeeping applicants who sought employment at its Shadeland Avenue Hampton Inn facility between approximately September 2, 2008 and June 2009.</p>
<p>Making employment decisions based on race and/or taking actions against employees who complain of race discrimination violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   The EEOC filed suit (Case No.  1:10-cv-1234) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement.  The agency is seeking back pay, compensatory and punitive damages against New Indianapolis Hotels Inc., as well as other relief, including a permanent injunction to prevent the company from engaging in future race discrimination and/or retaliation.</p>
<p>“Employers cannot choose employees based on the color of their skin, nor can employers treat employees differently based on the color of their skin and this blatant race discrimination by the Shadeland Avenue Hampton Inn facility clearly violated federal law,” said Laurie A. Young, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Indianapolis District Office.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency’s web site at www.eeoc.gov.   Further information about this lawsuit can be obtained by calling the EEOC at (317) 226-7212.</p></div>
