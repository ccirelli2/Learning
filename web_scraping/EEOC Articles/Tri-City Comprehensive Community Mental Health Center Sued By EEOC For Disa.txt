<h1>Tri-City Comprehensive Community Mental Health Center Sued By EEOC For Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong>Northern Indiana Operator of Mental Health Facilities Refused to Accommodate Employee With Breast Cancer</strong></p>
<p>Tri-City Comprehensive Community Mental Health Center, a large Northern Indiana operator of multiple community mental health facilities, refused to accommodate an employee who required leave for breast cancer treatment, according to a lawsuit filed on November 8, 2010 by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). </p>
<p>According to the EEOC’s lawsuit, in 2009, Felicia Nichols, who worked at a Tri-City facility in Hammond, Ind., sought leave for breast cancer treatment.  Tri-City failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation and then terminated her for missing work, the EEOC said.</p>
<p>Failing to make a reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee with a disability who requires an accommodation to perform his or her job violates the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA).  The EEOC asserts that the company’s actions were intentional and demonstrated a reckless indifference to Nichols’ federally protected rights.</p>
<p>The EEOC filed suit (Case No.  2:10-cv-00444-PPS-APR in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, Hammond Division) after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement. The agency is seeking back pay and compensatory and punitive damages against Tri-City, as well as other relief, including a permanent injunction to prevent the company from engaging in future disability discrimination. </p>
<p>“An employer cannot simply ignore requests for reasonable accommodation and then fire a disabled worker, telling her to reapply for employment when her condition improves,” said Laurie A. Young, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Indianapolis District Office.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency’s web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.  The EEOC’s Indianapolis Office is located at 101 W. Ohio Street, Suite 1900, Indianapolis, IN 46204. </p></div>
