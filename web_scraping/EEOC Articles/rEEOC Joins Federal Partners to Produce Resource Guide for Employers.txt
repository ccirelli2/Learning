<h1>EEOC Joins Federal Partners to Produce Resource Guide for Employers</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Guide Creates Central Repository of User-Friendly Information and Resources to Increase Employment Opportunities for People with Disabilities</strong></em></p>
<p>WASHINGTON - On Tuesday, Feb. 3, at a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/03/advancing-employment-opportunities-people-disabilities" id="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/03/advancing-employment-opportunities-people-disabilities|">Summit on Disability and Employment</a>, the White House announced a new guide for employers that compiles key federal and federally funded resources
related to the employment of people with disabilities. The resource guide, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/employing_people_with_disabilities_toolkit_february_3_2015_v4.pdf" id="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/employing_people_with_disabilities_toolkit_february_3_2015_v4.pdf|">Recruiting, Hiring, Retaining, and Promoting People with Disabilities</a>, provides employers with plain language technical
assistance tools in an easy-to-use question-and-answer format.  The guide was produced by the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/interagency/curb_cuts.cfm" id="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/interagency/curb_cuts.cfm|">Curb Cuts to the Middle Class
Initiative</a> -- a federal interagency effort working to increase equal employment opportunities and financial independence for people with disabilities. </p>
<p>The goal of the Curb Cuts to the Middle Class Initiative is to coordinate and leverage existing resources across the federal government. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces Title I of the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA), and the Office of EEOC Commissioner Chai R. Feldblum has played a leadership role in the Curb Cuts Initiative.</p>
<p>As Commissioner Chai Feldblum explained, "We have heard time and time again that employers do not want to visit ten government websites to access the information they need.  This resource guide is an example of federal agencies coming
together to respond to the needs of employers by creating a central repository of user-friendly information and resources.  I am proud of the integral role the EEOC played in putting this resource guide together."</p>
<p>"This resource guide underscores the EEOC's commitment to conduct proactive outreach and education to help businesses strengthen efforts to recruit, hire, retain, and promote people with disabilities," said EEOC Chair Jenny R. Yang.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.  For more information, go to www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
