<h1>William Tamayo Named District Director of the EEOC’s San Francisco District Office</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON-William Tamayo, who served as a regional attorney for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for the past 20 years, was named director of the agency's San Francisco District Office, EEOC Chair Jenny R. Yang
announced.</p>
<p>"It is a pleasure to welcome William Tamayo as the new director for the San Francisco District Office," Yang said. "During his long career with the agency, Mr. Tamayo has worked tirelessly on behalf of victims of discrimination. I am
confident that he will lead the San Francisco office with passion and commitment."</p>
<p>Tamayo joined the EEOC in 1995 as a regional attorney in the San Francisco District Office. In that capacity, he helped the agency to achieve monetary relief for a black worker who faced harassment and retaliation (<em>EEOC v.
Lockheed-Martin</em>) as well as for disabled workers denied accommodations or jobs (EEOC v. Walmart), among other important cases.</p>
<p>Before joining the EEOC, Tamayo was a managing attorney for the Asian Law Caucus, Inc., where he specialized in civil and voting rights litigation and advocacy on employment discrimination and immigrant rights.</p>
<p>"I want to thank Chair Jenny Yang for giving me the opportunity to lead the EEOC's efforts to stop and remedy employment discrimination in the San Francisco area," said Tamayo. "Our district, a large diverse area covering seven states,
boasts some of the largest high-tech, agricultural, service industry, and government employers in the country. As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the EEOC, recent events remind us all there is much more to be done. I look forward
to working with our stakeholders to enforce our federal civil rights laws."</p>

   

<p>The EEOC enforces the nation's laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
