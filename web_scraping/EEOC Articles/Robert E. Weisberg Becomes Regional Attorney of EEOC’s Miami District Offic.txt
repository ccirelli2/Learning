I look forward to becoming part of the EEOC’s efforts to enforce civil rights laws and fulfill its mission of eradicating employment discrimination.”</p>
<p>Weisberg has previously litigated many types of civil rights cases in Miami, including representing hundreds of men and women who were discriminated against in employment based on race, gender, color, national origin, religion, age and disability. Weisberg has also prosecuted civil rights actions based on racial discrimination in denial of public accommodations and to enforce violations of voting rights and racial discrimination in the provision of governmental services.</p>
<p>Weisberg is board certified by the Florida Bar in the area of Labor and Employment Law and has been recognized in Best Lawyers in America in an area of practice including employment law, and has also been recognized for his legal work by a number of other publications.
