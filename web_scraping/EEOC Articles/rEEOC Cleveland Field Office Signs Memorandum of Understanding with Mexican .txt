</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Agreement Establishes Ongoing Collaborative Relationship to Combat Discrimination</strong></em></p>
<p>CLEVELAND -- The Cleveland Field Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Detroit Consulate of Mexico today.  The agreement establishes an ongoing
collaborative relationship between these two entities to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance, and access to resources on the prevention of discrimination in the workplace, regardless of documentation status.  Mexican Consul
Vicente Sanchez Ventura and Cynthia Stankiewicz, acting director of the EEOC's Cleveland Field Office, will sign the agreement.   </p>
<p>The Mexican Consulate in Detroit provides services to preserve the rights of Mexican nationals residing in Michigan and Ohio.  The EEOC's Cleveland Field Office enforces federal employment discrimination laws and has jurisdiction over half
of the State of Ohio.</p>
<p>"A Memorandum of Understanding promotes employment justice and allows us to continue current practices which are in place," said Spencer H. Lewis, Jr., district director of the EEOC's Philadelphia District, which oversees Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Delaware, West Virginia and parts of New Jersey and Ohio.   </p>
<p>Under the terms of the MOU, the EEOC will expand its cooperation with the Mexican Consulate, providing it with Spanish-language materials explaining the laws enforced by the EEOC.  The agency will also provide representatives to meet with
Mexican nationals in Ohio in order to disseminate information and conduct counseling regarding employment discrimination matters.</p>
<p>The EEOC and the Mexican Consulate will work together regularly to provide information regarding workplace discrimination on Spanish-language radio stations throughout their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment.  Further information about the agency is available by calling 1-800-669-4000 and on its website at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
