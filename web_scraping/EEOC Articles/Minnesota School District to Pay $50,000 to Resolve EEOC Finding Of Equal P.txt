<h1>Minnesota School District to Pay $50,000 to Resolve EEOC Finding Of Equal Pay Discrimination</h1>

<p>MINNEAPOLIS - In a conciliation agreement signed today with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Montevideo School District in Minnesota has agreed to pay $50,000 and reclassify the position of a female employee who was
performing the duties of a custodian but was classified in a lower-paid custodial aid position, the agency announced today.</p>
<p>An investigation by EEOC's Minneapolis Area Office revealed that the Montevideo School District failed to pay a female custodial aid wages equal to that of a custodian, a position which was held by her male coworker, even though the two performed
job duties that were the same as or equivalent in skill, effort and responsibility. The custodial aid position is an hourly position and pays almost less than half of the salaried custodian position. Following the investigation, EEOC determined that
there was reasonable cause to believe that the school district was violating the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
<p>In addition to paying $50,000 to the female employee, the conciliation agreement requires the Montevideo School District to reclassify her to a custodian position and adjust her pay accordingly; provide annual anti-discrimination training to all
of its employees; and submit to EEOC all allegations of wage discrimination made by employees to the School District during the agreement's three-year term.</p>
<p>"EEOC is committed to full enforcement of Title VII and the Equal Pay Act to ensure that women are paid equally for their work in the same jobs as men," said Julie Schmid, acting director of the agency's Minneapolis Area Office.</p>
<p>Julianne Bowman, district director of EEOC's Chicago District Office, added, "In this day and age it is unfortunate that women still have to fight for equal pay."</p>
<p>The Minneapolis Area Office is part of EEOC's Chicago District. The Chicago District is responsible for investigating charges of discrimination in Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and North and South Dakota.</p>
<p>EEOC enforces federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
