<h1>Allegiance Industries Pays $25,000 to Settle EEOC Gender Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Female Supervisor Was Fired by District Manager Who Wanted a Man in Her Position, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>ATLANTA – Allegiance Industries, Inc., a cleaning service company with work sites throughout the Atlanta area, will pay $25,000 to settle a gender discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.</p>
<p>The agency had alleged that Allegiance Industries, Inc. discriminated against Brenda Lowery, a female cleaning team supervisor, by firing her in July 2009 because the district manager wanted a male supervisor at the cleaning site where she worked. Immediately after Lowery was fired, Allegiance Industries placed a male supervisor at the work site that she supervised.</p>
<p>Gender discrimination violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit on April 27, 2010 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>“Firing someone simply because of her gender is unjust and unlawful, plain and simple,” said EEOC Regional Attorney Robert K. Dawkins. “The EEOC will continue its fight against such workplace discrimination that still causes so much distress to so many Americans.” </p>
<p>The consent decree settling the suit, in addition to monetary relief for Lowery, includes provisions for equal employment opportunity training, reporting and postings.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency’s web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
