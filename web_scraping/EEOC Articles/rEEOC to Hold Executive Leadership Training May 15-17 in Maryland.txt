<p>WASHINGTON – The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will hold its second executive leadership training summit (ELC) from May 15 to 17 at the Hyatt Regency in the town of Cambridge.  Online registration and additional information is available at <a href="http://www.eeocleadershipconference.com/" id="http://www.eeocleadershipconference.com/|">http://www.eeocleadershipconference.com/</a></p>
<p>The ELC is designed to meet the professional development needs of senior leaders in the field of equal employment opportunity (EEO).   “This training will directly address core leadership competencies, ensuring that EEO professionals have the executive training necessary to meet the challenges of our profession,” said Carlton Hadden, director of EEOC’s Office of Federal Operations.  “In these times of fiscal austerity, this is a very cost effective and modest investment in the skill set of federal employees,” Hadden said.  </p>
<p>Training will address key leadership competencies, personal development, and other critically important topics vital to the success of current and future executives – particularly senior EEO officials for federal, state and local governments; private sector EEO executives; HR executives with responsibility for managing and implementing an EEO program; as well as those striving to attain senior level positions.  </p>
<p>Highlights include plenary sessions with key government officials, such as EEOC Chair Jacqueline Berrien, former Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, and other leaders.  Speakers will include experts from academia, private industry, and government – including OPM’s Federal Executive Institute, the George Washington University Center for Excellence in Public Leadership, Howard University, and Franklin Covey.  The 2012 ELC is not to be missed by those eligible to attend – with more than a dozen workshop choices to maximize professional and personal development.  The event will also include a special Women’s Forum and panel discussion of the implications for women as leaders in the federal sector workplace.  </p>
<p>Space is limited and the registration deadline is fast approaching.  Registration is limited to the GS-14 level and above, and private sector equivalents. </p>
<p>The EEOC enforces laws prohibiting discrimination in the federal and private sectors. Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
