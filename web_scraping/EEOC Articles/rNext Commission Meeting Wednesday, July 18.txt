<h1>Next Commission Meeting Wednesday, July 18</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON – The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will hold a meeting on Wednesday, July 18, at 9:30 a.m. (Eastern Time), at agency headquarters, 131 M Street, N.E. In accordance with the Sunshine Act, the open session of the meeting will be open to public observation of the Commission’s deliberations and voting. For scheduling purposes, the meeting is anticipated to conclude at 4:30 pm.</p>
<p>In February, the Commission approved a <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/strategic_plan_12to16.cfm">Strategic Plan</a> for Fiscal Years 2012-2016. The first performance measure of the Strategic Plan requires the Commission to approve a Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP), which it is now developing. In June, the Commission <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/6-5-2012.cfm">solicited</a> written public input into the development of the SEP. On July 18, the Commission will hear publically from five roundtables of invited guests on what the agency’s national enforcement priorities should be for the next three years in order to have the greatest impact on combating discrimination in the workplace. The participants will also address recommendations for improving enforcement, outreach and prevention, and customer service.</p>
