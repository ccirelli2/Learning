<h1>Ann Arbor Days Inn Sued by EEOC for Sexual Harassment and Retaliation</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Supervisor Attempted Sexual Assault on Employee, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich. – The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today that it has filed a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit against Ann Arbor Nights, Inc., doing business as Days Inn Hotel of Ann Arbor, in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division (Case No. 2:10CV12197).</p>
<p>The EEOC’s suit charged that the Days Inn violated federal law when a supervisor subjected a female housekeeper to a sexually hostile work environment including inappropriate sexual comments, physical assaults, and at least one attempted sexual assault. The EEOC also said that the housekeeper was discharged following her repeated attempts to complain about the harassment.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a voluntary settlement out of court through its conciliation process. The EEOC is seeking to recover monetary compensation in the form of compensatory and punitive damages and an injunction enjoining Days Inn from further subjecting its employees to a sexually hostile work environment or retaliating against individuals who complain.</p>
<p>“Attempted sexual assault is one of the most egregious forms of sexual harassment,” explained EEOC attorney Nedra Campbell. “When it’s at the hands of a supervisor, it’s even worse,” she added.</p>
<p>The Ann Arbor Days Inn is a franchise of Days Inns Worldwide, which is part of the Wyndham Worldwide family of hotels.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
