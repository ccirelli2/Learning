<h1>EEOC Sends Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on ADA and Wellness Programs to OMB for Clearance</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>WASHINGTON- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on March 20 voted to send a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on the interplay of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with respect to
wellness programs to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance. </p>
<p>This proposed rule, which was approved by a bipartisan vote, would amend the regulations implementing the equal employment provisions of the ADA to address the interaction between Title I of the ADA and financial incentives as part of wellness
programs offered through group health plans. </p>
<p>The submission of the NPRM to OMB represents the start of the regulatory process. After OMB approval, the proposed rule will be published in the Federal Register for a 60-day public notice and comment period. The NPRM cannot be made public prior
to its publication in the Federal Register.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at www.eeoc.gov.<br/>
