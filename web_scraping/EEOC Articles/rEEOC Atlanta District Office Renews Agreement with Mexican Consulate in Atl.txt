</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Agreement Continues Collaborative Relationship to Combat Employment Discrimination</strong></em></p>
<p>ATLANTA - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Atlanta District Office and the Consulate General of Mexico in Atlanta renewed its Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today.  The Director of the EEOC Atlanta District Office,
Bernice Williams-Kimbrough, and Consul General Ricardo Camara Sanchez, signed the agreement.</p>
<p>"This agreement continues an ongoing collaborative relationship to provide Mexican nationals with information, guidance and access to education and training resources to help them exercise their workplace rights," said Williams-Kimbrough. 
"It also serves a key objective of the EEOC's Strategic Enforcement Plan, which includes protecting the rights of immigrants, migrant and other vulnerable workers throughout the country."</p>
<p>Over the past several years, the EEOC has worked closely with the Mexican Consulate in Atlanta to provide EEOC materials and training in Spanish and English, serve as a resource to the Consulate and its constituents, provide a referral system for
charges from Mexican nationals, provide guidance and assistance on charge filing and anti-discrimination employment laws, counsel potential charging parties, conduct outreach in Spanish at the Consulate and in underserved areas and participate in
the Consulate's mobile unit outreach and Labor Rights Week.  Under the terms of the MOU, these efforts will continue.  Additionally, the EEOC will partner with the Consulate to provide information and training to areas of the state where
migrant farm workers and other Mexican nationals live and work.    </p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws that prohibit employment discrimination.  The EEOC Atlanta District Office covers the entire state of Georgia and 12 counties in South Carolina.  More information about the EEOC is
available on its website at www.eeoc.gov in both English and Spanish and by calling 1-800-669-4000 (TTY 1-800-669-6820).<br/>
