<h1>Holiday Systems Voluntarily Settles EEOC  Sex Harassment &amp; Retaliation Charges  After Agency Finds Violation</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p>LAS VEGAS - Holiday Systems International, a Las Vegas-based travel wholesaler, has agreed to settle alleged sex harassment and retaliation charges filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced
today. The settlement was reached after EEOC's investigation found Holiday Systems International violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (Title VII). Eight female employees alleged they were targets of sex harassment by a senior-level company
official due to their gender and that some of the alleged victims were retaliated against upon reporting the harassment. Although Holiday Systems International denies the allegations, the travel wholesaler agreed to resolve the matter in a timely
manner.</p>
<p>The women filed discrimination charges with the EEOC in 2009 and 2010. The EEOC ultimately found reasonable cause to believe that the travel wholesaler violated Title VII for the sex-based harassment, retaliatory discharge and constructive
discharge.</p>
<p>To demonstrate their support of Title VII, and without admitting liability, Holiday Systems International entered into a two-year conciliation agreement with the EEOC and the women. Aside from the monetary relief, the Holiday Systems agreed to
appoint a third-party consultant to assist in the review and possible revision of the company's anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies and procedures. The company is also required to provide anti-harassment training to all employees with
supplemental training for managers and supervisors on the laws enforced by EEOC. The agreement further requires that the company maintain its record-keeping system to track and monitor complaints. The EEOC will monitor compliance with the
agreement.</p>
<p>"We commend Holiday Systems International for agreeing to implement measures to prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation in the workplace," said Amy Burkholder, director of the EEOC's Las Vegas Local Office. "Employers should serve as
models for behavior in ensuring compliance with federal civil rights laws and taking steps to both prevent and address such issues."</p>
<p>Preventing workplace harassment through systemic litigation and investigation is one of the six national priorities identified by the EEOC's Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP).</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
