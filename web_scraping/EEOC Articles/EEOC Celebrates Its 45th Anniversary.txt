<h1>EEOC Celebrates Its 45th Anniversary</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON – July 2, 2010, marks the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/45th/chairs_statement.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=109538,chairs_statement.cfm,140|">45th anniversary of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</a>. Created by the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964, the EEOC was founded to enforce Title VII of that Act, which prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. On July 22, 2010 the EEOC will also celebrate the 20th anniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which expanded employment opportunities for physically, emotionally and mentally disabled people.</p>
<p>The EEOC also enforces the Equal Pay Act, which requires that men and women receive equal pay for performing equal work; the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which made clear that Title VII’s prohibitions against sex discrimination include pregnancy; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, protecting people age 40 and over from employment discrimination; and the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act, which bars employers from using genetic information to make employment decisions.</p>
<p>The work of the EEOC in enforcing these important civil rights laws has helped to transform the American workplace and achieve justice for countless individuals.</p>
<p>“The EEOC is proud of its 45 year history of advancing the goal of equal employment opportunity but must continue working to fulfill the mission of ending employment discrimination across the United States,” said EEOC Chair Jacqueline A. Berrien in a statement posted on the EEOC’s website.</p>
<p>The EEOC will celebrate its anniversary in a series of events at its headquarters in Washington, D.C., and its offices across the country, beginning in July, 2010. In addition, the EEOC’s website, www.eeoc.gov, will be updated with anniversary materials periodically.</p>
<p>The first event in honor of the EEOC's 45th anniversary year <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/7-15-10.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=110179,7-15-10.cfm,50|">will recognize the 20th anniversary of the ADA</a>. The Commission will host a panel discussion on Thursday, July 22, from 2:00-4:00 p.m. in the EEOC Training Center in Washington, D.C., on the ADA’s impact on millions of Americans with disabilities in the workplace, and will recognize people associated with the EEOC at the time of the passage of the ADA who played a significant role. This event will be free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Additional information about the agency can be found on its web site at www.eeoc.gov.</p></div>
