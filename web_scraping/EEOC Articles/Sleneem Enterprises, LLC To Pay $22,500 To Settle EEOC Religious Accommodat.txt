<h1>Sleneem Enterprises, LLC To Pay $22,500 To Settle EEOC Religious Accommodation Suit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Company Discharged Employee Because She Requested Religious Accommodation, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>DETROIT - A Michigan-based franchisee of Tim Hortons Cafe and Bake Shop will pay $22,500 to settle a religious accommodation lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today.</p>
<p>The EEOC's lawsuit charged that Sleneem Enterprises, LLC violated federal law by firing Amanda Corley after she requested a religious accommodation. According to the EEOC's lawsuit, in 2015, Corley was hired by Sleneem to work at the Tim Hortons
cafe in Romulus, Mich. On Nov. 16 of that year, Corley requested that she be permitted to wear a skirt instead of pants, in accordance with her Pentecostal Apostolic religious beliefs. Corley attempted to present a letter from her pastor, explaining
her need to wear a skirt. Rather than allow Corley to wear a skirt, Sleneem fired her, the EEOC said.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates Tile VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on their religious beliefs. The EEOC filed suit (<em>EEOC v. Sleneem Enterprises, LLC, dba Tim Hortons
Cafe and Bake Shop</em>, No. 2:17-cv-12337) in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>The consent decree settling the suit, in addition to providing for the award of monetary relief to Corley, prohibits any similar discrimination in the future and requires Sleneem to train its shift supervisors and managers on all forms of
discrimination prohibited by Title VII, including the obligation to provide reasonable religious accommodations.</p>
<p>"Under federal law, an employer has an obligation to fairly balance an employee's right to practice religion with operating its business," said Miles Uhlar, trial attorney for EEOC's Detroit Field Office. "When this obligation is not met, the
EEOC will step in and protect workers."</p>
<p>The EEOC's Detroit Field Office is part of the agency's Indianapolis District Office, which oversees Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, and parts of Ohio.</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the
