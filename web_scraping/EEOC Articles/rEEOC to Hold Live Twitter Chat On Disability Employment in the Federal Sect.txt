<p>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will hold a live Twitter chat on Tuesday, Oct. 28, from 2:00 to 3:00 pm (EDT). In commemoration of National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM), the interactive
online forum will focus on the federal government as a model employer of people with disabilities. EEOC Chair Jenny Yang and Commissioner Chai Feldblum will answer questions during the hour-long chat.</p>
<p>Members of the public are encouraged to participate by submitting questions using the hashtag <strong>#EEOC4NDEAM</strong>. The EEOC invites queries regarding the hiring, promotion and retention of people with disabilities in the federal
government and suggestions on how agencies can increase the number of people with disabilities in the federal workforce.</p>
<p>"We hope this Twitter Chat provides useful information about what the EEOC is doing to increase the employment of people with disabilities at all levels of federal service," said EEOC Chair Yang. "The EEOC is committed to ensuring our nation's
workplaces are inclusive of all people without regard to disability, race, color, sex, national origin, religion, age, or genetic information and family medical history, beginning with the federal workplace."</p>
<p>"As a long time devotee of Twitter, I am thrilled to have an interactive discussion about what the EEOC is doing, and what more it can do, to help people with disabilities find and retain good jobs in the federal government," said Commissioner
Feldblum.</p>
<p>The EEOC will conduct the chat using the agency's official Twitter handle <strong><em>@EEOCNEWS</em></strong>. During the Twitter chat, Commissioner Feldblum will be using her personal Twitter handle <em>@chaifeldblum</em>. </p>
<p>Members of the news media should direct questions to the EEOC's Office of Communications via email: <a href="mailto:newsroom@eeoc.gov" id="mailto:newsroom@eeoc.gov|">newsroom@eeoc.gov</a> or by phone at 202-663-4191 or TTY 202-663-4494.</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov" id="http://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
