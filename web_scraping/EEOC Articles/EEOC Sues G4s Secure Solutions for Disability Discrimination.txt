<h1>EEOC Sues G4s Secure Solutions for Disability Discrimination</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center">Security Firm Denied a Reasonable Accommodation to Security Officer With Lupus, Then Fired Her, Federal Agency Charges</p>
<p>DETROIT - G4S Secure Solutions USA, Inc., a Florida-based security firm which provides security services in Warren, Mich., violated federal law by denying a reasonable accommodation to an employee with a disability and then firing her, the U.S.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged in a lawsuit it filed today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's lawsuit, a G4S security officer suffered from mixed connective tissue disease and lupus. For years, security officer worked behind a desk. Without any explanation, her supervisor removed her from her desk job and placed
her in a foot patrol position. The officer had trouble working in the foot patrol position because of her medical condition and asked to return to her seated security position as a reasonable accommodation. However, G4S refused her request and
ultimately discharged her.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). After attempting to reach a pre-litigation resolution through its conciliation process, the EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District Court of Michigan
(EEOC v. G4S Secure Solutions USA, Inc., Case No. 2:17-CV-13195). The EEOC is seeking monetary relief for the employee and an injunction prohibiting the company from engaging in this type of conduct in the future.</p>
<p>"Federal law requires employers to make a good-faith effort to agree on an accommodation for workers with disabilities," explained EEOC Trial Attorney Nedra Campbell. "Why G4S couldn't allow this employee to return to her seated position is
puzzling, but it's clear that this is a case where the EEOC needs to step in and fight for this woman's rights."</p>
<p>G4S Secure Solutions USA, Inc., is based in Jupiter, Fla., and employs over 50,000 people in the United States and Canada.</p>
