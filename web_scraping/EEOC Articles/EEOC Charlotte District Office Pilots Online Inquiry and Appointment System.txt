<h1>EEOC Charlotte District Office Pilots Online Inquiry and Appointment System for The Public</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>New System Provides Online Interaction With the Federal Agency</em></strong></p>
<p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The Charlotte District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is one of five offices that will pilot the EEOC Online Inquiry and Appointment System, the district office announced today. The system
launched on March 13, 2017, and will allow people who live or work within 100 miles of the district office the ability to electronically submit an inquiry and schedule an in-person interview. The initial inquiry and interview are key initial steps
for individuals seeking to <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employees/howtofile.cfm">file a charge</a> of discrimination with the EEOC.</p>
<p>The EEOC receives about 200,000 inquiries per year through the mail, in person and by phone, and about 90,000 of those inquiries become formal charges of discrimination filed with the agency, making the charge-filing process the agency's most
common interaction with the public. This new online system is part of the EEOC's <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/act-digital-qanda.cfm">ACT Digital</a> initiative to improve service to the public, streamline the administrative process, and
reduce the use of paper submissions and files.</p>
<p>People can access the Online Inquiry and Appointment System at <a href="https://publicportal.eeoc.gov/Portal/">https://publicportal.eeoc.gov/Portal/</a> or from the EEOC's website at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employees/online_inquiry.cfm">https://www.eeoc.gov/employees/online_inquiry.cfm</a>. The agency plans to evaluate the public's experience with the new system prior to a nationwide rollout later this fiscal year.</p>
<p>"The Charlotte District Office is pleased to be one of the offices selected for the rollout of the Online Inquiry and Appointment System," said EEOC Charlotte District Director Reuben Daniels, Jr. "We recognize that more than ever online systems
are being used to request services and to conduct business. This system is a way for us to increase our interaction with, and be accessible to, the public we serve. We are available to answer questions and respond to feedback from users and can give
presentations on the system for stakeholder organizations. I am confident this system will be as well received as the other phases of ACT Digital."</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the
