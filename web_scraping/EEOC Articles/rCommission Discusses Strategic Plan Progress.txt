<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today held a <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/meetings/2-20-13/index.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=169388,index.cfm,175|">public meeting</a> to discuss implementation of the
Commission's fiscal year 2012-2016 Strategic Plan. The Commission approved the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/strategic_plan_12to16.cfm" id="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/strategic_plan_12to16.cfm|">Strategic Plan</a> in a 4-1 vote in
February 2012.</p>
<p>As stated in the Strategic Plan, the mission of the EEOC is to stop and remedy unlawful employment discrimination so that the nation can achieve our ultimate vision of justice and equality in the workplace. The plan serves as a framework for the
Commission in achieving this mission by focusing on three objectives: strategic law enforcement, education and outreach, and efficiently serving the public. The three strategic objectives each have a number of performance measures detailing outcomes
to be achieved during the four-year period the plan is in effect. The performance measures are designed to assess the Commission's progress in carrying out its mission in a time of static or declining resources and a growing need for its
services.</p>
<p>The Agency's Performance Improvement Officer (PIO), Claudia Withers, answered questions about Performance Plan 1, addressing the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/sep.cfm" id="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/sep.cfm|">Strategic Enforcement
Plan</a> (SEP) and each of the performance measures. Withers reiterated the agency's commitment to mission-critical thinking, transparent governance, interagency collaboration and public participation. While thanking EEOC staff for their dedication
and achievements, she added that work on the performance measures has mostly been accomplished through internal work groups. She added that holding such public meetings keeps the agency accountable to the public it serves.</p>
<p>Withers and Deputy PIO Deidre Flippen discussed the process of Strategic Plan implementation, and highlighted the fact that, of the 14 measures in the plan, the agency has met or exceeded the fiscal year 2012 expectations for eight, and partially
met the targets in two of the measures. The four remaining measures had no specific targets for fiscal year 2012. The Quality Control Plan is also on track for development this fiscal year. Details of these achievements are published in the agency's
<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/2012par.cfm" id="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/2012par.cfm|">2012 Performance and Accountability Report</a> (PAR). Withers said work on achieving further SEP plans and recommendations, including ones on the
development of sub-regulatory policy guidance; data and research; outreach and education; and national standard operating procedures, is already or soon will be underway. Flippen also described the implementation milestones achieved by the agency
since approval of the Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>Among the many benefits of the Strategic Plan, Withers pointed out that fulfillment of the plan's objectives depends on and actually promotes increased collaboration among EEOC staff, as well as ownership by staff of the plan's objectives. Agency
leaders echoed the tangible benefits of inclusive and collaborative implementation.</p>
<p>Moreover, Withers said, "Implementation of the Strategic Plan will help the Commission carry out its mission as efficiently as possible, in the short run. In the long run, the plan will set a strong foundation for the agency for years to
come."</p>
