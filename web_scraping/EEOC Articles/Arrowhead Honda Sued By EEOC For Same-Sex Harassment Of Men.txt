<h1>Arrowhead Honda Sued By EEOC For Same-Sex Harassment Of Men</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p align="center"><strong><em>Male Employees Subjected to Physical Harassment From General Sales Manager; Management Refused to Address the Misconduct, Federal Agency Charges</em></strong></p>
<p>PHOENIX – The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) today announced the filing of a sex harassment lawsuit against Larry Miller – Peoria, Inc. (which does business as Arrowhead Honda) on behalf of a class of men who were subjected to a hostile work environment by the General Sales Manager.</p>
<p>The EEOC charged in its lawsuit, (<em>EEOC v. Larry Miller – Peoria, Inc. d/b/a Arrowhead Honda, CV 10-2080-PHX-FJM</em>), filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, that Arrowhead Honda’s General Sales Manager repeatedly sexually harassed a class of men. The harassment included repeated sexual assaults by the General Sales Manager, who would grab, rub, and/or touch men in the groin area. The General Sales Manager also constantly engaged in a variety of sexual gestures, according to the complaint. According to the EEOC, Arrowhead Honda failed to address the harassment even though management knew about the harassment.</p>
<p>“ In 1998, the Supreme Court recognized that harassment is unlawful regardless of the gender of the victim or the harasser,” said Mary Jo O’Neill, Regional Attorney for the EEOC’s Phoenix District Office. “Because over the past decade sex harassment charges filed by men have increased, employers must be ever diligent in protecting all their employees from sexual harassment.”</p>
<p>EEOC Acting Phoenix District Director Rayford O. Irvin said, “We will continue to devote substantial resources to prosecute violations of the law prohibiting sex harassment regardless of gender.”</p>
<p>The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p></div>
