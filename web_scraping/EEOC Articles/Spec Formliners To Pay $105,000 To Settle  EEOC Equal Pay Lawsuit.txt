<h1>Spec Formliners To Pay $105,000 To Settle  EEOC Equal Pay Lawsuit</h1>
</div>
<div align="left"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Female Sales Representative Was Paid Less Than Her Male Coworker, Federal Agency Charged</em></strong></p>
<p>LOS ANGELES - Spec Formliners, Inc., a Santa Ana, Calif.-based business, will pay $105,000 and provide other relief to settle an equal pay lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced
today.</p>
<p>According to the EEOC's lawsuit, Spec Formliners paid a female sales representative less than a male sales representative in base pay. The EEOC also contended that the company required the female sales representative to sell more to earn the same
commission as her male colleague.</p>
<p>Such alleged conduct violates the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed its lawsuit on Nov. 17, 2016 in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (<em>EEOC v. Spec Formliners,
Inc.</em>, Case No. 8:16-cv-02066-BRO-AJW) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.</p>
<p>As part of the consent decree settling the suit, Spec Formliners will pay $105,000 to the former employee. In addition to the monetary relief, Spec Formliners also agreed to retain external equal employment opportunity consultants who will assist
the company in creating, reviewing and revising its policies and practices to ensure compliance with Title VII and the EPA. The external EEO consultants will also assist the company in conducting fair pay audits, reviewing and revising its
recruitment practices, and preparing annual reports for the EEOC on the company's progress. Spec Formliners further agreed to conduct anti-discrimination training and distribute the revised policies to all employees. The EEOC will monitor Spec
Formliners' progress with the 2.5-year decree.</p>
<p>"We commend Spec Formliners for agreeing to put measures in place that will help remove barriers for female sales representatives and ensure equal pay for equal work," said Anna Park, regional attorney of the EEOC's Los Angeles District, which
includes Orange County in its jurisdiction. "Employees will do their best work when they know that their efforts are fairly compensated."</p>
<p>Rosa Viramontes, director of the agency's Los Angeles District Office, added, "The changes that will be implemented as part of this settlement will ensure that female sales representatives will receive fair compensation for sales equal to those
of their male counterparts. This not only benefits female employees, but also the company as a whole."</p>
<p>According to the company's website, <a href="http://www.specformliners.com" id="http://www.specformliners.com|">www.specformliners.com</a>, Spec Formliners creates and customizes form liner patterns for concrete projects.</p>
<p>Enforcement of equal pay laws and targeting compensation systems and practices is one of the six national priorities identified by the Commission's Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP).</p>
<p>The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" id="https://www.eeoc.gov|">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Stay connected with the
